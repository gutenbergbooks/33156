<h2>ON THE LIFE AND POETIC GENIUS OF EDWARD YOUNG.</h2>
<p>Between the period of George Herbert, and that of
<span class="sc">Edward Young</span>, some singular changes had taken place in
British poetry as well as in British manners, politics, and
religion. There had passed over the land the thunderstorm
of the Puritanic Revolt, which had first clouded and
then cleared, for a season, the intellectual and moral horizon.
The effect of this on poetry was, for such fugitive though
felicitous hymns as those of Herbert, to substitute the epic
unities and grand choral harmonies of Milton. Then came the
Restoration&mdash;the Apotheosis of falsehood; including in that
term false principles, false politics, and false taste. Britain
became the degraded slave of France, at once in laws and in
literature. Dryden, indeed, maintained, in some measure, the
character and the taste of his nation, but he stood almost alone.
To him succeeded Addison and Pope, both gifted but both
timid men, whose genius, great as it was, never, or rarely,
ventured on original and daring flights, and who seemed
always to be haunted by the fear of French criticism. Pope,
especially, lent all his influence to confirm and seal the power
of a foreign code of literary laws; and so general and so deep
was the submission, that it is to us one of the strongest proofs
of Edward Young&rsquo;s genius, that he ventured, in that polished
but powerless era, to uplift a native voice of song, and not to
uplift it in vain; for, if he did not absolutely make a revolution,
<span class="pb" id="pg_vi">[vi]</span>
or found a school, he yet established himself, and left
his poetry as a glorious precedent to all who should afterwards
be so hardy as to &ldquo;go and do likewise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Edward Young was born in June 1681 (according to some,
two years earlier), in the village of Upham, Hampshire. His
father was rector of the parish, and is represented as a man of
great learning and abilities. He was the author of some volumes
of sermons, and, on account of their merit, and through the
patronage of Lord Bradford, he was appointed chaplain to
King William, and Dean of Salisbury. He died in 1705, in
the sixty-third year of his age, and Bishop Burnet, the Sunday
after his decease, pronounced a glowing panegyric on his
character, in a funeral sermon delivered in the Cathedral.</p>
<p>Edward was sent to Winchester School, and thence to
Oxford, where he obtained a law fellowship in All-Souls College,
and afterwards took successively the degrees of Bachelor
and Doctor of Civil Law, besides obtaining a fellowship in
1706. When the Codrington Library was founded, he was
appointed to deliver the Latin oration. It was published, but
met with a frigid reception, being full of conceits and puerilities,
and the author wisely omitted it from his collected works.
Little else is known of his career at College. He is said to
have blended fits of study with frequent dissipation. When
he relaxed, it was in the company of the infamous Duke of
Wharton, who patronised, corrupted, and laughed at him.
When he studied, he would shut his windows, create around
him an artificial night, and make it more hideous by piling
up skulls, cross-bones, and instruments of death in his room.
His talent was then as well known as his eccentricity. Tindal
the sceptic bore a striking testimony to this when he said,
&ldquo;The other boys I can always answer, because I always
know where they have their arguments, which I have read a
hundred times; but that fellow Young is continually pestering
me with something of his own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He seems to have been nearly thirty ere he began to tune
that lyre which was afterwards to thrill with vibrations of song
so powerful and melodious. His first choice of a subject was
characteristic of the lofty and ambitious tone of his genius: it
<span class="pb" id="pg_vii">[vii]</span>
was, &ldquo;The Last Day.&rdquo; This poem was written in 1710, although
not given to the world till 1713. He had previously,
in 1712, published an epistle to Lord Lansdown, which displayed
little of his peculiar power, but was at once feeble and
pretentious. Young became afterwards heartily ashamed of
it. In the same year that &ldquo;The Last Day&rdquo; appeared, he prefixed
to Addison&rsquo;s &ldquo;Cato&rdquo; a copy of verses of no great merit.
Shortly after, he issued a poem entitled, &ldquo;The Force of Religion;
or, Vanquished Love:&rdquo; it was founded on the story of
Lady Jane Grey and her husband, and was ushered in by a
flaming dedication to the Countess of Salisbury. On the
death of the Queen, in 1714, he published a panegyric in verse
on her memory, and inscribed it to Addison. In these days
flattery to princes and nobles was a commodity almost essential
to poetry&mdash;a tawdry court dress which every poet was
obliged to put on for the nonce; and not even Dryden has excelled
Young in the violent unlikeness and unsparing incense
of his adulations. It is satisfactory to remember that, on cool
reflection, he cancelled the most of those unworthy effusions;
although he continued to the last very much of a courtier, as
the dedications to the &ldquo;Night Thoughts&rdquo; sufficiently prove.
He is supposed about the year 1717 to have visited Ireland
in company with Wharton.</p>
<p>In 1719 his tragedy of &ldquo;Busiris&rdquo; appeared on the stage,
and had considerable success. He sold the copyright afterwards
to B. Lintot, for &pound;84, which, for a first play by
an author previously unknown, was thought a large sum.
&ldquo;Busiris&rdquo; is a play of that solemnly pompous and intensely
artificial school, the race of which has been long since
gathered to its fathers. It is conceived and written in
Ercles&rsquo; vein;<sup><a id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></sup> and Nat Lee himself, in his wild ranting
plays, has scarcely surpassed the torrents of bombastic nonsense
which issue from the lips of Myron. Immediately after
&ldquo;Busiris&rdquo; he published his Paraphrase on part of the Book of
Job, a production scarcely worthy either of Young or of the sublime
original. The descriptions in that grandest of all poems,
which are so rich and massive as to press almost on the sense,
are more fairly represented in our common prose translation
<span class="pb" id="pg_viii">[viii]</span>
than in the poetical paraphrase of Young. We are far,
however, from being opposed, with some critics, to the principle
of paraphrasing Scripture. We admire to enthusiasm
many of the Scottish paraphrases, some of Byron&rsquo;s and
Moore&rsquo;s Hebrew Melodies, and Croly&rsquo;s <i>Scenes from Scripture</i>;
and should like to see all the poetry of the Bible versified
by some competent hand.</p>
<p>In 1721 appeared &ldquo;The Revenge,&rdquo; by far the most powerful
of his tragedies. Its great fault lies in its likeness to
Othello: its great praise is, that, though it imitates and challenges
comparison with that Shakspearean masterpiece, it has
not been utterly sunk and eclipsed before it. As a play, we
think it decidedly second-rate; the plot is not artistically managed,
and the means by which jealousy is excited in the
mind of Alonzo, are a very poor and shabby copy of those in
Shakspeare. Zanga has been called a &ldquo;vulgar caricature of
Iago;&rdquo; he is so in part, perhaps, but Young has abated the
vulgarity of the imitation by endowing his hero with a wild
and native vein of poetry. Iago is a subtler, colder fiend
than Zanga, and indulges more in sneers and in smut than
in declamation. Zanga&rsquo;s speeches exhaust the rhetoric of
revenge. Iago has nothing but intellect, wit, and malignity.
Zanga has an imagination worthy of the hot and lion-peopled
land of his birth. Iago, after his detection, sinks into obstinate
silence; he stiffens into the statue of a demon. Zanga
dies, using lofty imagery.</p>
<p>Indeed, &ldquo;The Revenge&rdquo; owes all its interest to the flames
of poetic genius which burst out at every pore of its otherwise
coarse and copied structure. It was dedicated to Wharton,
with whom Young continued to be intimate; whom he taught to
speak good Latin <i>in the space of six weeks</i>; and who lent him
money to reimburse him for the expenses of an unsuccessful attempt
to get into Parliament. This was in 1721; the place was
Cirencester. The election, however, was contested, and fortunately,
perhaps, both for Young and the world, he was
unsuccessful. Had he gained the seat, he had very probably,</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Though born for the universe, narrow&rsquo;d his mind,</p>
<p class="t0">And to party given up what was meant for mankind;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="pg_ix">[ix]</div>
<p>and what comparison between a series of eloquent, forgotten
speeches, and the starry, ever-burning splendours of the
&ldquo;Night Thoughts&rdquo;?</p>
<p>His disappointment in this attempt, coupled, probably, with
remorse for the follies and vices of a misspent youth, seems to
have soured Young, and ripened him to the point when
satire becomes the unavoidable expression of the irritated
yet unsubdued spirit. In 1725 appeared the first part of
his &ldquo;Universal Passion;&rdquo; the rest came out in successive
satires between that and 1728, when they were collected
and published, along with a somewhat querulous preface, in
which he hints that he had not found poetry very favourable
to preferment. He gained, however, &pound;3000 by these poems,
of which, according to Spence, &pound;2000 was contributed by
the Duke of Grafton, who did not, however, regret the
price. His inscriptions of the several satires were, as
usual at the time, stuffed with fulsome praise of such men
as Dorset, Dodington, Campton, and Sir Robert Walpole,
all of whom appreciated and rewarded the compliments. We
reserve our criticism on these remarkable productions till
afterwards, noticing only at present, that they were published
<i>before</i> the satires of Pope, and that they became instantly
popular.</p>
<p>As if to propitiate the Nemesis, who always stands behind
the chariot of the popular writer, Young next issued two of
the poorest of all his unequal productions. The first of these,
entitled &ldquo;The Instalment,&rdquo; was addressed to Sir Robert
Walpole, and is, perhaps, although the word be a wide one,
the most nonsensical and trashy <i>lie in verse</i> ever addressed
to a prime minister. The second is an &ldquo;Ode to Ocean,&rdquo;
a compound of doggrel and stilted dulness&mdash;which, indeed,
any sailor of education might have composed, if &ldquo;half-seas-over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At length, sick of dissipation, of the stage, of bad odes,
and good satires, Young determined to become wise, and
enter into orders. An irresistible current had long been
carrying him on, with many a convulsive recalcitration on his
part, to this determination. That great intellect and heart,
<span class="pb" id="pg_x">[x]</span>
over which, already, the shadow of the &ldquo;Night Thoughts&rdquo;
was beginning to gather, could not be satisfied with the
society of &ldquo;peers, poets,&rdquo; and demireps; with the applause
of sweltering crowds collected in theatres; or with the ebullitions
of its own giant spleen, in the shape of epigrammatic
satires. The world, which once seemed to his eye so fresh
and fair, had withered gradually to a skeleton, with sockets
for eyes, with eternal baldness for hair, with a &ldquo;stench instead
of a sweet savour, and burning instead of beauty.&rdquo;
He resolved to proclaim the particulars of this painful yet
blessed disenchantment to the ends of the earth, and to all
classes of mankind. And for this purpose, he first of all
mounted the pulpit, and then began to wield what was even
then the mightier engine of the press. He was no novice
when he entered the ministry. Would that we had more
who, like Young, do not go up by a mechanical ladder, and
the mere force of custom, to the pulpit, but who come down
upon it from long and vain wanderings elsewhere, and with
a conviction, as the result of mature experience, that God
there still desires to dwell, and that it constitutes even yet a
pinnacle of prospect, and power, and promise! Thus came
Herbert, and Chalmers, and Foster, to their real work as
ministers of the gospel. It is not a boy, but a Boanerges-ministry
that introduces the Word with most effect to a gainsaying
world. Young was full forty-seven&mdash;mature in years,
in acquirements, in experience, and in reputation&mdash;when he
began to publish the &ldquo;News that it is well.&rdquo; Like the eminent
men we have just mentioned, and like others whom we
might mention, his motives in entering the Church have been
calumniated. He has been compared to a lady disappointed
in love, taking the veil; and, rather inconsistently with this
figure, to a sated sensualist becoming an anchorite. How can
both be true? If Young was disappointed, how could he be
sated? and if sated, how could he be chagrined by the want
of satisfaction? The fact is, that such men as Young,
Chalmers, Herbert, and Foster, are altogether superior to
common standards of judgment, and must be tried by their
peers. All had their own share of the disgusts and dissatisfactions
<span class="pb" id="pg_xi">[xi]</span>
connected with life, and all felt them keenly. But all
had a deeper reason still&mdash;a reason, we grant, probably stirred
by circumstances into action, for renouncing the empty arena
of this world&rsquo;s honours and wealth, and devoting themselves
to a higher and nobler purpose. They all saw into the hollowness
of society, into the misery of the human heart; and
felt that the gospel alone could fill that aching void, and
satisfy those dreary cravings. Hence, Herbert quitted the
pleasures of a court; Chalmers dropped his air-pump and his
telescope; Foster resigned his philosophic speculations; and
Young shook off the blandishments of peers, and forgot
the claps of multitudes, to proclaim the glad tidings to
perishing sinners; and verily all, in different measures, had
their reward.</p>
<p>In April 1728 he was appointed chaplain to George II.
His tragedy, &ldquo;The Brothers,&rdquo; which had been in rehearsal,
was prudently withdrawn. It is a play superior to &ldquo;Busiris,&rdquo;
but very much inferior to &ldquo;The Revenge.&rdquo; Full of passion
and poetry, of startling scenes, and vivid images, its subject
is unpleasing, and the various perplexities of the plot are not
skilfully disentangled.</p>
<p>In the same year he published &ldquo;A True Estimate of
Human Life,&rdquo; written with force and ingenuity; and a long
and very loyal sermon, preached before the House of Commons,
on the Martyrdom of Charles I. It was entitled, &ldquo;An
Apology for Princes; or, the Reverence due to Governments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hitherto Young had lived on the proceeds of his fellowship,
and on presents from Wharton, who, at his death, too, left him
a pension. He became now, however, very naturally anxious
for promotion in that new sphere on which he had entered,
and was compelled, <i>proh pudor</i>! to lay his case before Mrs
Howard, the favourite mistress of George II.&mdash;that identical
&ldquo;good Howard,&rdquo; who figures so curiously in the famous scene
between Jeanie Deans and Queen Caroline. The fact of the
application, as well as the terms of the letter he wrote her,
renders this the most humiliating incident in all Young&rsquo;s
history. In 1730, he published &ldquo;Imperium Pelagi,&rdquo; another
naval lyric, as bad and much longer than his &ldquo;Ode to Ocean.&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="pg_xii">[xii]</span>
In the same year he wrote an epistle to Pope, which resembles
a coarser and more careless production of the little man of
Twickenham.</p>
<p>In July 1730, Young was presented by his college to the
rectory of Welwyn in Hertfordshire. We refer our readers,
for various delightful speculations and anecdotes about his
residence and labours there, to Bulwer&rsquo;s <i>Student</i>. He
was a powerful preacher. His sermons seem to have been
striking in thought, rich in image, intensely practical in
tendency, and were delivered with great animation and effect.
It is told, that on one occasion, while preaching at St James&rsquo;s
before the Court and His Majesty, on some subject of transcendent
importance, and not being able to command the attention
or awaken the feelings of his audience, he at length
threw himself back into the pulpit, and burst into tears.
That was itself a sermon! The figure of this weeping Titan,
who could have rent rocks and severed mountains, but who
had failed in breaking the hearts of any of his courtly hearers,
is one of the most affecting in the annals of pulpit oratory.
Alas! what preacher who has ever aimed at Young&rsquo;s object,
has not been at times tempted to assume Young&rsquo;s attitude, and
to shed Young&rsquo;s bitter and burning tears? &ldquo;Who hath
believed our report, and to whom is the arm of the Lord
revealed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1731, Young, at the mature age of fifty, married the
Lady Elizabeth Lee, daughter of the Earl of Lichfield, and
widow of Colonel Lee. This marriage sprung out of his
father&rsquo;s acquaintance with Lady Ann Wharton, who was co-heiress
of Sir Henry Lee of Ditchley in Oxfordshire, and
seems to have been very happy. He next published another
of those stupid odes by which he seemed predestined to disgrace
his genius, entitled &ldquo;A Sea Piece.&rdquo; It was as though
Milton had tried to write Anacreontics. A few years afterwards
appeared &ldquo;The Foreign Address, or the Best Argument
for Peace,&rdquo; occasioned by the posture of affairs in which the
British fleet was then placed, and written in the character of
a sailor. It is a mere tissue of sounding verbiage&mdash;or, as
Hamlet hath it, &ldquo;Words, words, words.&rdquo; About this time
<span class="pb" id="pg_xiii">[xiii]</span>
Young met with Voltaire, who, according to the story, was
ridiculing Milton&rsquo;s allegory of &ldquo;Death and Sin,&rdquo; when our
hero struck in with the extempore epigram:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Thou art so witty, profligate, and thin,</p>
<p class="t0">That thou thyself art Milton, Death, and Sin.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>We cannot see very much wit in this epigram, even in that best
shape which we have now given it; but it was not inappropriate
to the lean denier, who sought to empty everything of
the important element&mdash;its God; to leave the universe, like
himself, a grinning skeleton, and to smile in ghastly sympathy
over the completed ruin. We fancy we see the two gifted
men, the one the representative of the scepticism of France,
the other, of the belief of England, meeting and conversing together.
Voltaire is not much in advance of thirty; Young is
fifty, and more. Voltaire&rsquo;s face is worn with premature thought
and inordinate laughter; Young&rsquo;s, though older, bears a warmer
and more sanguine flush. Voltaire has the insincerest of
smiles playing constantly over his face like the light of an
aurora borealis; Young&rsquo;s countenance is grave, settled, open,
and serene, as the radiance of an autumn sunset. In Voltaire&rsquo;s
eye you see the future &ldquo;Candide&rdquo; laughing down in its depths,
while on Young&rsquo;s brow lies the dim and magnificent promise
of the &ldquo;Night Thoughts.&rdquo; After meeting, talking, bowing,
wondering, and recoiling, they part for ever; Voltaire sighing
through smiles as he thinks of the &ldquo;misled giant of Religion;&rdquo;
and Young smiling through sighs as he thinks of the &ldquo;wondrous
and well-nigh human ape of Infidelity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By his wife Young had one son, Frederick. He does not
seem to have been a particularly well-behaved youth; indeed,
his father for some time before his death refused to see him,
although he ultimately sent him his forgiveness, and made
him his heir. But no son of illustrious father has ever had
harder measure dealt him. It has been generally supposed
that he was the Lorenzo of the &ldquo;Night Thoughts,&rdquo; a poem
published when Frederick was only eight years of age, and
when he could scarcely have even thought of committing
those crimes of scepticism and reckless self-gratification with
which Young charges his imaginary or half-real hero.</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_xiv">[xiv]</div>
<p>The Poet&rsquo;s life, during the first ten years of his rectorship
at Welwyn, flowed on in an even tenor. He was regular in
his conduct, happy in his family, diligent in his pastoral
duties, and easy in his fortune. His preaching was popular
and useful. His studies were principally connected with his
own profession, and yielded him a growing satisfaction. An
anonymous writer in the <i>Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine</i> for 1782,
who seems to have been intimate with him, thus describes him:&mdash;&ldquo;The
dignity of a great and good mind appeared in all his
actions, and in all his words. He conversed on religious subjects
with the cheerfulness of virtue; his piety was undebased
by gloom or enthusiasm; he was regular in the performance
of all its duties, both in public and in private. In his domestic
character he was amiable as he was venerable in the
Christian. His politeness was such as I never saw equalled:
it was invariable to his superiors in rank; to his equals and
to his inferiors it differed only in degrees of elegance. I never
heard him speak with roughness to the meanest servant. In
conversation upon lively subjects he had a brilliancy of wit
which was peculiar to himself; I know not how to describe it
but by saying that it was both heightened and softened by
the amiable qualities of his soul. I have seen him ill and in
pain, yet the serenity of his mind remained unruffled. I never
heard a peevish expression fall from his lips.&rdquo; Few of his
brilliancies are preserved, since, unfortunately, he had no Boswell
attached to his heels. But one or two of the sayings
that have floated down to us are singularly characteristic.
On one very stormy night Young went out to his garden, and
remained some time. When he returned, one expressed wonder
why he had stayed so long in such an evening. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he
replied, &ldquo;it is a very fine night; <i>the Lord is abroad</i>.&rdquo; He was
very fond of a garden, and inscribed on the wall of his summer-house
the words, <i>Ambulantes in horto audiebant vocem Dei</i>
(Walking in the garden, they heard the voice of God). He
had also erected a dial with the inscription, <i>Eheu fugaces!</i>
which, he said with a smile to Mr Langton, &ldquo;was sadly verified,
for by the next morning my dial had been carried off.&rdquo;
Though sometimes melancholy, he was disposed to encourage
<span class="pb" id="pg_xv">[xv]</span>
mirth in others, and established an assembly and bowling-green
in his parish.</p>
<p>And had this been all&mdash;had Young continued to pursue
such an even, equable course&mdash;he had been by this time well-nigh
forgotten; for we do not think that either his satires or
plays would of themselves have preserved his name. But it
was decreed that grief should co-operate with disappointment
in unfolding the full riches of his mind. Ant&aelig;us was strongest
when he touched the ground. Job was never so eloquent
till he was prostrated on his dunghill. And, in order to be
able to write the &ldquo;Night Thoughts,&rdquo; Young must be plunged
in the deepest gloom of affliction&mdash;&ldquo;Thrice flew the shaft,
and thrice his peace was slain.&rdquo; In 1736, a daughter of his
wife, by a former husband, died. This was Mrs Temple&mdash;the
Narcissa of his great poem. Her disease was a lingering one.
Young accompanied her to Lyons, where she died, and where
her remains were brutally denied sepulture, as the dust of a
Protestant. Her husband, Mr Temple, or Philander, died
four years later; and in 1741, Young&rsquo;s wife, or Lucia, also expired.
He now felt himself alone, and blasted in his solitude.
But his grief did not sink into sullen inactivity. He made
it oracular, and distilled his tears into song. The &ldquo;Night
Thoughts&rdquo; were immediately commenced, and published
between 1742 and 1744. This marvellous poem was all
composed either at night, or when riding on horseback&mdash;an
exercise, by the way, which gives a sense of mastery and confidence,
stirs the blood, elevates the animal spirits, and has
been felt by many to be eminently favourable to thought and
mental composition. It inspired, we know, such men as Burns,
Byron, Shelley, and Delta. We love to think of Young
riding through the green lanes of his parish, and cooing out
to himself his plaintive minstrelsies. We love better still to
watch his lonely lamp shining at midnight, like a star, through
the darkness, and seeming to answer the far signal of those
mightier luminaries which are burning above in the Great
Bear and Orion&mdash;the poet the while now dipping his pen to
indite his ardent immortalities&mdash;now leaning his head on his
widowed arm, and surrendering himself to paroxysms of uncontrollable
<span class="pb" id="pg_xvi">[xvi]</span>
anguish&mdash;and now looking out upon the Night as the
&ldquo;Lord is abroad&rdquo; on the wings of the tempest, or as He is
silently shining out his name in suns and galaxies&mdash;those unwearied
&ldquo;Watchers&rdquo; and unbaptized &ldquo;Holy Ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1745, Young wrote &ldquo;Reflections on the Public Situation
of the Kingdom&rdquo;&mdash;a production which made no impression at
the time, and is now entirely forgotten. He did not include
it in the collection of his works. In 1753, the tragedy of
&ldquo;The Brothers,&rdquo; which had lain past for thirty years, was produced
on the stage. Young gave the profits of the play, and
several hundreds from his own pocket, amounting to a thousand
pounds in all, to the Society for the Propagation of the
Gospel&mdash;an act which surely balances the stories usually told
of his love of money and thirst for preferment.</p>
<p>His next work was, &ldquo;The Centaur not Fabulous, in Six
Letters to a Friend.&rdquo; Its subjects were, the infidelity and
licentiousness of that age. It is a pity that this book has
fallen into oblivion, as it is a very rich and powerful piece
of writing. It is full of clear, sharp, sententious truth.
Its style palpitates with energy, and glitters with poetic
image. We wish we saw it reprinted in a cheap form; for,
although infidelity and pleasure have both materially changed
their phases, there is much in Young&rsquo;s little work that has
an imperishable application, and that would be even yet
eminently useful. The character of Altamont is supposed to
represent Lord Euston&mdash;a nobleman notorious for his vices.
The age in which Young&rsquo;s lot was cast was characterised by
a low, sneering scepticism, and his earnest and awful letters
were treated with ridicule. Many pronounced him mad,
others whispered about dotage. <i>Now</i>, the book seems replete
with wisdom, and burning almost with prophetic fire.</p>
<p>Young, in fact, was not generally appreciated during his
lifetime. Tried by the Boileau and Pope standard, his writings
were pronounced turgid, strained, and extravagant. Even
Warburton, who should have known better, passed a severe
judgment on the &ldquo;Night Thoughts.&rdquo; He had, however, his
warm admirers, prominent among whom was the amiable and
learned Joseph Warton. He dedicated to Young his &ldquo;Essay
<span class="pb" id="pg_xvii">[xvii]</span>
on Pope&rdquo;&mdash;an essay containing the first sober and discriminating
estimate of that most artificial of true poets, and with
the opinions expressed in which Young is supposed to have
coincided; for, although he admired, and too often imitated,
Pope&rsquo;s brilliant point and antithesis, he was aware of far
higher models, and found Homer, Milton, and Job far more
congenial companions in his studious midnights. In 1758, he
published a short and in nowise remarkable sermon, preached
before the King at Kensington.</p>
<p>Richardson, the novelist, was one of Young&rsquo;s greatest
friends. Their views on moral and religious subjects were
identical; and in gravity of tone, and severity of genius, they
resembled each other&mdash;Richardson being a duller Young, and
Young a more elastic and brilliant Richardson. Although
both lived in a most depraved age, neither catered to its
tastes. To Richardson, Young addressed, in 1759, a letter on
Original Composition, which betrays no symptoms of senility,
but is full of vigorous and striking remark. In 1762, when
upwards of eighty, he wrote his last and worst poem. It is
entitled &ldquo;Resignation,&rdquo; and requires, on the part of the
reader, considerable exercise of that grace. It has very little of
Young&rsquo;s peculiar power, and is chiefly filled with weak and
toothless abuse of his old acquaintance Voltaire. It was
written, it appears, at the instance of Mrs Boscawen&mdash;the
widow of the Admiral&mdash;who, having found consolation from
the &ldquo;Night Thoughts,&rdquo; visited Young, and was still more
captivated by his conversation.</p>
<p>During the latter years of his life, he is said to have fallen
too much under the dominion of his housekeeper, Mrs
Hallowes, the widow of a clergyman, who is reported to have
ruled him with a rod of iron. Ere his death he revised his
printed works, and gave charges in his will that all his MSS.
should be burned. He applied, when past eighty, to Archbishop
Secker for promotion, and was appointed Clerk of the
Closet to the Princess-Dowager of Wales. In April 1765, at
the age of eighty-four, he breathed his last. He had been
previously unable to perform duty for three or four years, but
retained his faculties to the last. He left his property principally
<span class="pb" id="pg_xviii">[xviii]</span>
to his son, who was found by Johnson and Boswell, in
1781, residing at Welwyn, and cherishing the memory of his
father.</p>
<p>Young was unquestionably a neglected man. Out of all
sight the greatest genius then connected with the ministry of
the Church of England, he never mounted one step higher
than the rectorship his own college had conferred on him.
Many reasons have been assigned for this. Some say that it
was because he had attached himself to the side of Frederick,
Prince of Wales, and had preached an obnoxious sermon at
St James&rsquo;s; others, that it was because he had received a
pension through Sir Robert Walpole. We think that the
real cause lay in the vulgar and senseless prejudice which
prevailed then, and in some measure prevails still, against
a literary divine, as if he were a hybrid, or &ldquo;centaur, not
fabulous.&rdquo; Let us not blame that age so long as we remember
the burning shame reflected on ours by the fact that the
gifted and high-charactered author of <i>Salathiel</i>, and <i>Paris</i>
in 1815, is still only the rector of St Stephen&rsquo;s, Walbrook,
while many younger men, who in comparison with him are
of little mark, have reached the episcopal bench. Probably
Young felt himself consoled for his bad success, by the
knowledge that his name and great poem had travelled to
foreign lands, and that Madame Klopstock was wondering&mdash;good,
simple soul!&mdash;that her husband&rsquo;s idol and her own, had
not been made Archbishop of Canterbury.</p>
<p>Very little beyond what we have mentioned has been left
on record about his private habits and manners. It was his
custom, when well pleased with a passage in the course of his
reading, to double down the leaf&mdash;when particularly gratified,
to mark it by two folds; and some favourite works, such as
<i>The Rambler</i>, had so many of these marks of approbation
that they would not shut. On one occasion, in replying to
Tonson and Lintot, who were both candidates for printing
one of his works, he misdirected the letters; and when Lintot
opened his, he found it begun&mdash;&ldquo;Bernard Lintot is so great
a scoundrel,&rdquo; &amp;c. Young was proverbial for absence of mind,
and sometimes forgot whether he had dined or not. Yet in
<span class="pb" id="pg_xix">[xix]</span>
Welwyn his mode of life was rather systematic. He rose
early, made his domestics join him in morning prayer, read
little, ate and drank moderately, walked much in his churchyard,
and, in general, retired to rest punctually at eight evening.
His son told Dr Johnson that he was cheerful in company,
but gloomy when alone, and that he never fully recovered his
spirits after his wife&rsquo;s death. Mr Jones, his curate, has confirmed
this statement, although the gossipping and heartless
tone of his letters about such a man cannot be too strongly
condemned. Young was subject to fits of inspiration, which
stupid people confounded with madness. At times his poetry
rushed upon him like a whirlwind, and caught him up</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Like swift Ezekiel, by his lock of hair&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>and when he came down he seemed weak, panting, and
powerless. Mrs Boscawen and others describe his conversation
as still more remarkable than his writings, although
occasionally disfigured by conceits and bad puns.</p>
<p class="tb">We come now to speak of his genius, especially as manifested
in the &ldquo;Night Thoughts.&rdquo; The subject of this wonderful
strain was one which, in its novelty, dignity, and depth,
challenged the very highest exercise of the very highest
faculties; and had Young risen to the full height of his great
argument, he had become the greatest of all poets. This we
by no means affirm he did; but we do assert, that many of the
aspects of his magnificent theme have been fully and eloquently
expressed by him, and that some of his passages are
unsurpassed in the language of men.</p>
<p>The poem demands a brief critical consideration as to its
<i>season</i>, its <i>argument</i>, its <i>imagery</i>, its
<i>style</i>, its <i>versification</i>, its <i>comparative
place</i> and <i>merit</i>, and, lastly, the <i>genius</i> of its
author. First, of its <i>season</i>&mdash;the Night&mdash;and the
use to which he turns it. Night had never before found a worthy
laureate. Its profound silence, as if it were listening to catch
the accents of some supernal voice&mdash;the shadowy grandeur and
mysterious newness it gives to objects on the earth&mdash;the divine
hues into which its moon discolours all things&mdash;the deep sleep
<span class="pb" id="pg_xx">[xx]</span>
which then falleth upon men, and changes the world into one
hushed grave&mdash;the supernatural shapes and mystic sounds
which have been supposed to walk in its darkness, or to echo
through its depths&mdash;the voices scarce less solemn, which often
break its silence, of howling winds, and wailing rivers, and
shrieking tempests, and groaning thunders, and the wild cries
of human misery and despair&mdash;and last and highest, its withdrawal
of the bright mist and mantle of day from the starry
universe, and the pomp with which it unrols and exhibits its
&ldquo;great map&rdquo; of suns and systems&mdash;its silvery satellites&mdash;its
meek planets, each shining in its own degree of reflected splendour&mdash;its
oceans of original and ever-burning fire called suns&mdash;its
comets, those serpents of the sky, trailing their vast
volumes of deadly glory through the shuddering system&mdash;its
fantastic and magnificent shapes and collocations of stars,
the constellations&mdash;its firmaments rising above firmaments,
like rounds in a ladder, at the top of which is the throne of
God&mdash;and those two awful arms into which its Milky Way
diverges, and which seem uplifted to heaven in silent prayer,
or in some deep and dread protest,&mdash;all these elements of
interest and grandeur had existed from the beginning of the
world in Night, and yet had never, till Young arose, awakened
any consecutive and lofty strain of poetic adoration. Many
beautiful and many sublime sentiments had been uttered by
poets about particular features of Night, but there had been no
attempt to represent it as a whole. There were many single
thoughts, but no large and sounding Hymn. The views
of the Pagan poets about astronomy were, of course, warped
by the absurd systems of their day; and this served to damp
their fire, and to render their poetic tributes rather fantastic
than truly powerful. Even Dante and Milton are somewhat
embarrassed by the Ptolemaic system, although it proves the
strength of their genius that they have extracted so much
poetry from it. But before Young arose,</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Nature and nature&rsquo;s laws lay hid in night;</p>
<p class="t0">God said, Let Newton be, and all was light;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>and he has set the Newtonian system to his own martial
music.</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_xxi">[xxi]</div>
<p>We are far from contending that Young has exhausted the
poetry of the theme. Since his time the telescopes of Herschell
and Lord Rosse have been turned to the skies, and have
greatly extended the size and splendour of that vast midnight
Apparition&mdash;the starry scheme. Our recent poets have
availed themselves of these discoveries, as witness the eloquent
rhapsodies about the stars by Bailey, A. Smith, and
Bigg. And there is even yet room for another great poem
on the subject, entitled &ldquo;Night,&rdquo; were the author come. But
Young deserves praise for the following things:&mdash;</p>
<p><i><span class="normal">1</span>st</i>, He has nobly sung the magnitude and unutterable glory
of the starry hosts. His soul kindles, triumphs, exults under
the midnight canopy. As the Tartar horse when led forth from
his stable to the free steppes and free firmament of the desert,
bounds, prances, and caracoles for joy, so does Young, in the
last part of his poem. Escaped from dark and mournful contemplations
on Man, Death, Infidelity, and Earth&rsquo;s &ldquo;melancholy
map,&rdquo; he sees the stars like bright milestones on the
way to heaven, and his spirit is glad within him, and tumultuous
is the grandeur, and fierce and rapid the torrent, of
his song.</p>
<p><i><span class="normal">2</span>dly</i>, He has brought out, better than any other poet, the
religion of the stars. &ldquo;Night,&rdquo; says Isaac Taylor, &ldquo;has
three daughters, Atheism, Superstition, and Religion.&rdquo; Following
out this fine thought, we see Atheism looking up with
impudent eye, brazen brow, and naked figure, to the midnight
sky, as if it were only a huge toy-shop of glittering gew-gaws;
Superstition shrouding herself in a black mantle, and falling
down prostrate and trembling before these innumerable fires,
as if they were the eyes of an infinite enemy; while Religion
turns aloft her humble, yet fearless form, her tear-trembling
yet radiant visage, and murmurs, &ldquo;My Father made them all.&rdquo;
Young, we need scarcely say, finds in the nocturnal heavens
lessons neither of Atheism nor of Superstition, but of Religion,
and reads in the face of Old Night her divine origin, the
witness she bears to the existence of God, her dependence
upon her Author, and her subordination to His purposes. He
had magnified, as Newton himself could not so eloquently
<span class="pb" id="pg_xxii">[xxii]</span>
have done, the extent of the universe; and yet his loyalty
to Scripture compels him to intimate that this system, so
far from being God, or infinite, or, strictly speaking, Divine,
is to perish and pass away. One look from the angry
Judge, one uplifting of His rod, and its voluminous waves
of glory, like another Red Sea, are to be dried up, that
the people of God may pass through and enter on the land
of the real Immortality, the &ldquo;inheritance incorruptible, undefiled,
and that shall never fade away.&rdquo; We refer our readers
to that most eloquent picture, near the beginning of the Ninth
Night, of the Last Day. We once heard a lecturer on chemistry
close a superb description of the material universe, with
the words, &ldquo;And it is to shine on for ever.&rdquo; We thought of
the words of Peter, &ldquo;All these things shall be dissolved.&rdquo;
And then we fancied an invisible animalcule inhabiting one
of the mountain peaks of a furnace, looking abroad from one
of its surging spires, and saying, &ldquo;This wondrous blaze is to
burn for ever,&rdquo; and yet, ere a few hours have passed, the flame
is sunk in ashes, and the animalcule is gone. So the Heavens
shall pass away with a great noise. They shall perish, but
Thou God remainest; nay, thou Man, too, art destined to survive
this splendid nursery, and to enter on new Heavens
and a new Earth!</p>
<p>The argument of the &ldquo;Night Thoughts&rdquo; may be stated
in general to be as follows:&mdash;It is to shew the vanity of
man as mortal; to inculcate the lowness, misery, and madness
of the sensual life; to prove the superiority of the Christian
to the man of the world, both in life and in death, and the
worthlessness of merely human friendship; to argue, from
nature and reason, the truth of man&rsquo;s immortality; to shew
the reasonableness of religion, and to inculcate the necessity
of a divine revelation, and of a propitiatory sacrifice. That this
argument is always steadily pursued, or logically pled, we
do not pretend. It has its flaws;&mdash;we particularly demur to
many of its proofs of the immortality of the soul, which
seem to us very feeble and unsatisfactory; but, taking it as a
whole, it is unanswerable and overwhelming. Its links are of
red-hot iron; its appeals to the conscience are irresistible; and
<span class="pb" id="pg_xxiii">[xxiii]</span>
he who can read it with indifference, or rise from it unimpressed
and unawed, must be either something worse or something
less than man. It needs not to be surrounded by panegyrics.
Convinced, purified, elevated, saved Souls, are the gems
in its crown. We are inclined to believe that, in this aspect,
the &ldquo;Night Thoughts&rdquo; has effected more practical good
than the &ldquo;Paradise Lost.&rdquo; The latter is a splendid picture;
the former a searching, powerful sermon. Now, although
pictures with a strong moral contained in them have often
done much good, they want the point, emphasis, and effect of
great sermons. You may gaze long enough at Milton with
no feeling besides admiration of his genius; but in every page
Young is grappling with your conscience, and saying, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
look at me, but look to yourself.&rdquo; Foster, one of the greatest
of our practical reasoners on religion, has been much indebted
to Young, whom he resembled also in the sombre grandeur of
his genius.</p>
<p>Young&rsquo;s imagery is distinguished by its richness, originality,
and exceeding boldness. It was verily a new thing in that
timid and conventional age. Like the imagery of all highest
poets, it is selected alike from low and from lofty objects, from
the gay and the gloomy, from stars and dunghills. His mind
moves along through the poem like a great wheel, now
descending and now ascending, easy to criticise, but impossible
to resist. You may question the taste of many of his figures,
such as that of the Sun&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Rude drunkard, rising rosy from the main;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>or when he speaks of God as the &ldquo;Great Philanthropist;&rdquo; or
calls the moon &ldquo;the Portland of the skies;&rdquo; but you always
feel yourself in contact with a new, native, overflowing mind&mdash;with
a mind which has read nature through man, and man
through nature. There is to Young&rsquo;s genius nothing common
or unclean in the material universe. <i>All</i> points up to God, and
looks round significantly to man. His imagination has no limits,
and, when he is thoroughly roused, like the war-horse of Job,
the &ldquo;glory of his nostrils is terrible;&rdquo; it is the fury of power,
the revel of conscious wealth, the &ldquo;prancing of a mighty one;&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="pg_xxiv">[xxiv]</span>
not the dance of mere fancy, but the earnestness and energy
of one treading a winepress alone. In proof of this, we appeal
to his splendid passages on the miserable state of Man,
on Dreams, on Procrastination, to one half of his defence of
Immortality, and to the whole of his descant on the Stars.
This every one feels is power&mdash;barbarous power, if you will&mdash;savage,
mismanaged power, if you please to call it so; but
power that moves, agitates, overwhelms, hurries you away
like an infant on the stream of a cataract.</p>
<p>His diction is, on the whole, a worthy medium to his
thought. It has been somewhat spoiled by intimacy with
Pope&rsquo;s writings, and is often vitiated with antithesis, an excess
in which was the mode of the day. Now and then, too,
he is coarse and violent, to vulgarity, in his expressions. But
whenever he forgets Pope, and remembers Milton&mdash;or, still
more, when he becomes swallowed up in the magnitude of his
theme&mdash;his language is easy, powerful, and magnificent. It
never, as Mitford asserts, is unsupported by a &ldquo;corresponding
grandeur of thought.&rdquo; There is more thought in Young&rsquo;s
poem&mdash;more sharp, clear, original reflection&mdash;more of that
matter which leaves stings behind it&mdash;more moral sublimity&mdash;than
in any poem which has appeared since in Britain. Mitford
says, that &ldquo;every image is amplified to the utmost.&rdquo; Some
images unquestionably are; but amplification is not a prevailing
vice of Young&rsquo;s style&mdash;it is, indeed, inconsistent with that
pointed intensity which is his general manner; and how comes
it, if he be a diffuse and wordy writer, that his pages literally
sparkle with maxims, and that, next perhaps to Shakspeare, no
poet has been so often quoted? What the same writer means
by Young &ldquo;fatiguing the reader&rsquo;s mind,&rdquo; we can understand;
since it is fatiguing to look long at the sun, or to follow the
grand parabola of the eagle&rsquo;s flight; but how he should &ldquo;dissatisfy&rdquo;
the mind of any intelligent and candid reader, is to
us extraordinary. It is not true that the work has &ldquo;a uniformity
of subject.&rdquo; Its tone is rather uniform, but its subjects
are as varied as they are important. They are&mdash;Man&mdash;the
World&mdash;Ambition&mdash;Pleasure&mdash;Infidelity&mdash;Immortality&mdash;Death&mdash;Judgment&mdash;Heaven&mdash;Hell&mdash;the
Stars&mdash;Eternity. Mr
<span class="pb" id="pg_xxv">[xxv]</span>
Mitford compares Young to Seneca; as if a cold collector of
stiff maxims, and a poet whose wisdom was set in enthusiasm
as in a ring of fire, were proper subjects of comparison. And
it is strange how he should introduce the name of Cicero, as
if he were not that very master of amplification, and of over-copiousness
of expression, which Mitford <i>imagines</i> Young
to be! &ldquo;No selection&mdash;no discreet and graceful reservation&mdash;no
experienced taste!&rdquo;&mdash;in other words, he was not Pope
or Campbell, but Edward Young&mdash;not a middle-sized, neat,
and well-dressed citizen, but a hirsute giant&mdash;not an elegant
<i>parterre</i>, but an American forest, bowing only to the old
Tempests, and offering up a holocaust of native wealth and
glory, not to Man, but to God.</p>
<p>His versification is a more vulnerable point. We grant at
once that it is, as a whole, rugged and imperfect, and that,
while his single lines are often exceedingly melodious, he
rarely reaches, any more than Pope or Johnson, those long
and linked swells of sound&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Floating, mingling, interweaving,</p>
<p class="t0">Rising, sinking, and receiving</p>
<p class="t0">Each from each, while each is giving</p>
<p class="t0">On to each, and each relieving</p>
<p class="t0">Each, the pails of gold, the living</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>which Go&euml;the has so beautifully, although unintentionally,
described in these words, applied by him to the elements of
Nature; and which he and Milton, and Spenser, and Coleridge,
and Shelley, have so admirably exemplified in their verse.
Young&rsquo;s style is too broken and sententious to permit the
miracles of melody which are found in some of our poets.
Yet he has a few passages which approach even to this high
standard. Take the following:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Look nature through, &rsquo;tis revolution all;</p>
<p class="t0">All change, no death. Day follows night, and night</p>
<p class="t0">The dying day; stars rise and set and rise;</p>
<p class="t0">Earth takes th&rsquo; example. See the summer gay,</p>
<p class="t0">With her green chaplet, and ambrosial flowers,</p>
<p class="t0">Droops into pallid autumn; winter gray,</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_xxvi">[xxvi]</div>
<p class="t0">Horrid with frost, and turbulent with storm,</p>
<p class="t0">Blows autumn, and his golden fruits away;</p>
<p class="t0">Then melts into the spring. Soft spring, with breath</p>
<p class="t0">Favonian, from warm chambers of the south,</p>
<p class="t0">Recalls the first.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Or take the well-known burst which closes the First
Night:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The sprightly lark&rsquo;s shrill matin wakes the morn;</p>
<p class="t0">Grief&rsquo;s sharpest thorn hard pressing on my breast,</p>
<p class="t0">I strive, with wakeful melody, to cheer</p>
<p class="t0">The sullen gloom, sweet Philomel! like thee,</p>
<p class="t0">And call the stars to listen: every star</p>
<p class="t0">Is deaf to mine, enamour&rsquo;d of thy lay.</p>
<p class="t0">Yet be not vain; there are, who thine excel,</p>
<p class="t0">And charm through distant ages: wrapt in shade,</p>
<p class="t0">Prisoner of darkness! to the silent hours</p>
<p class="t0">How often I repeat their rage divine,</p>
<p class="t0">To lull my griefs, and steal my heart from woe!</p>
<p class="t0">I roll their raptures, but not catch their fire,</p>
<p class="t0">Dark, though not blind, like thee, M&aelig;onides!</p>
<p class="t0">Or his, who made M&aelig;onides our own.</p>
<p class="t0">Man, too, he sung; immortal man I sing;</p>
<p class="t0">Oft bursts my song beyond the bounds of life;</p>
<p class="t0">What, now, but immortality, can please?</p>
<p class="t0">O had he press&rsquo;d his theme, pursued the track</p>
<p class="t0">Which opens out of darkness into day!</p>
<p class="t0">O had he, mounted on his wing of fire,</p>
<p class="t0">Soar&rsquo;d where I sink, and sung immortal man!</p>
<p class="t0">How had it bless&rsquo;d mankind, and rescued me!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The reader will notice how, in this noble passage, the individual
sentences and points are all subordinated to the main
purpose of the poet, and being subjected to the general stress
of the strain, do not detract from, but add to, its musical
unity.</p>
<p>The comparative place of the poem, and the genius of the
writer, are two subjects which are closely connected, and indeed
slide into each other. The &ldquo;Night Thoughts&rdquo; must not
be named, in interest, finish, sustained sublimity, and artistic
completeness, with the &ldquo;Iliad,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Divina Commedia,&rdquo; or
the &ldquo;Paradise Lost.&rdquo; It ranks, however, at the top of such
a high class of poems as Cowper&rsquo;s Poems, Thomson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Seasons,&rdquo;
Byron&rsquo;s Poems, Blair&rsquo;s &ldquo;Grave,&rdquo; Pollock&rsquo;s &ldquo;Course of
<span class="pb" id="pg_xxvii">[xxvii]</span>
Time,&rdquo; and a few others not very often criticised now-a-days.
Young, however, seems to us to have been capable of even
higher things than he has effected in his works. He was
one of those prolific, fiery, inexhaustible souls, who never
seem nearing a limit, or dreaming of a shallow in their
genius; who, often stumbling over precipices or precipitated
into pools, rise stronger, and rush on faster, from their misadventures;
who, sometimes stopping too long to moralise on
fungi and ant-hillocks, are all the better breathed to career
through endless forests, and to take Alps and Andes at a
flying leap; and who are</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Ne&rsquo;er so sure our pleasure to create,</p>
<p class="t0">As when they tread the brink of all we hate.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>His taste was not equal certainly to his other faculties,
and he was guilty of occasional extravagances, and stumbled
not unfrequently over the brink of the bathos; but his
genius possessed the following qualities:&mdash;It was original.
He had read much, but he copies little, and never slavishly.
His mind looks at everything&mdash;at skulls and stars&mdash;through a
medium of its own. It was subtle as well as native and
strong, and in its movements it is broadly based on a vigorous
intellect. It was progressive and prophetic in its spirit, and
many of our recent speculations or semi-speculations on the
relations of man and nature, are to be found in Young&mdash;ay, in
the mere spray his mind threw off on its way to an ulterior
result. Think of this, for instance, and then remember a
similar expression in Carlyle:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t2">&ldquo;Man&rsquo;s grief is but his grandeur in disguise;</p>
<p class="t0">And discontent is immortality.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Finally, his genius, with all its compass and daring, was
reverent and religious. He gloried in the universe; he swam,
as it were, and circled like a strong swimmer, in that starry
sea; but he bent before the Cross, and, instead of looking up,
looked down, and cried out, &ldquo;God be merciful to me a
sinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We commend his masterpiece to readers, partly, indeed,
for its power,&mdash;a power that has hitherto rather been felt than
<span class="pb" id="pg_xxviii">[xxviii]</span>
acknowledged, rather admired in silence than analysed; but
principally because, like &ldquo;The Temple&rdquo; of Herbert, it is holy
ground. The author, amid his elaborate ingenuities, and wilful
though minor perversities, never ceases to love and to
honour truth; in pursuit of renown, he is never afraid to glory
in the Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ; and if his flights of fancy
be at times too wild, and if his thoughts be often set to the tune
of the tempest, it is a tempest on whose wings, to use his own
simple but immortal words, &ldquo;The Lord is abroad.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>THE COMPLAINT:
<br /><span class="smallest">OR,</span>
<br /><span class="small">NIGHT THOUGHTS.</span></h2>
<h3>PREFACE.</h3>
<p>As the occasion of this Poem was real, not fictitious; so the
method pursued in it was rather imposed by what spontaneously
arose in the Author&rsquo;s mind on that occasion, than meditated
or designed. Which will appear very probable from
the nature of it. For it differs from the common mode of
poetry, which is, from long narrations to draw short morals.
Here, on the contrary, the narrative is short, and the
morality arising from it makes the bulk of the Poem. The
reason of it is, that the facts mentioned did naturally pour
these moral reflections on the thought of the Writer.</p>

<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Tired Nature&rsquo;s sweet restorer, balmy Sleep!</p>
<p class="t0">He, like the world, his ready visit pays</p>
<p class="t0">Where Fortune smiles; the wretched he forsakes;</p>
<p class="t0">Swift on his downy pinion flies from woe,</p>
<p class="t0">And lights on lids unsullied with a tear.</p>
<p class="t">From short (as usual) and disturb&rsquo;d repose,</p>
<p class="t0">I wake: how happy they, who wake no more!</p>
<p class="t0">Yet that were vain, if dreams infest the grave.</p>
<p class="t0">I wake, emerging from a sea of dreams</p>
<p class="t0">Tumultuous; where my wreck&rsquo;d desponding thought<span class="lnum"> 10</span></p>
<p class="t0">From wave to wave of fancied misery</p>
<p class="t0">At random drove, her helm of reason lost.</p>
<p class="t0">Though now restored, &rsquo;tis only change of pain,</p>
<p class="t0">(A bitter change!) severer for severe:</p>
<p class="t0">The day too short for my distress; and night,<span class="lnum"> 15</span></p>
<p class="t0">Even in the zenith of her dark domain,</p>
<p class="t0">Is sunshine to the colour of my fate.</p>
<p class="t">Night, sable goddess! from her ebon throne,</p>
<p class="t0">In rayless majesty, now stretches forth</p>
<p class="t0">Her leaden sceptre o&rsquo;er a slumbering world.</p>
<p class="t0">Silence, how dead! and darkness, how profound!</p>
<p class="t0">Nor eye, nor listening ear, an object finds;</p>
<p class="t0">Creation sleeps. &rsquo;Tis as the general pulse<span class="lnum"> 23</span></p>
<p class="t0">Of life stood still, and nature made a pause;</p>
<p class="t0">An awful pause! prophetic of her end.</p>
<p class="t0">And let her prophecy be soon fulfill&rsquo;d;</p>
<p class="t0">Fate! drop the curtain; I can lose no more.</p>
<p class="t">Silence and darkness: solemn sisters! twins</p>
<p class="t0">From ancient Night, who nurse the tender thought</p>
<p class="t0">To reason, and on reason build resolve<span class="lnum"> 30</span></p>
<p class="t0">(That column of true majesty in man),</p>
<p class="t0">Assist me: I will thank you in the grave;</p>
<p class="t0">The grave, your kingdom: there this frame shall fall</p>
<p class="t0">A victim sacred to your dreary shrine.</p>
<p class="t0">But what are ye?&mdash;</p>
<p class="t">Thou, who didst put to flight</p>
<p class="t0">Primeval Silence, when the morning stars,</p>
<p class="t0">Exulting, shouted o&rsquo;er the rising ball;</p>
<p class="t0">O Thou, whose word from solid darkness struck</p>
<p class="t0">That spark, the sun; strike wisdom from my soul;<span class="lnum"> 40</span></p>
<p class="t0">My soul, which flies to thee, her trust, her treasure,</p>
<p class="t0">As misers to their gold, while others rest.</p>
<p class="t0">Through this opaque of nature, and of soul,</p>
<p class="t0">This double night, transmit one pitying ray,</p>
<p class="t0">To lighten, and to cheer. O lead my mind,</p>
<p class="t0">(A mind that fain would wander from its woe),</p>
<p class="t0">Lead it through various scenes of life and death;</p>
<p class="t0">And from each scene the noblest truths inspire.</p>
<p class="t0">Nor less inspire my conduct, than my song;<span class="lnum"> 49</span></p>
<p class="t0">Teach my best reason, reason; my best will</p>
<p class="t0">Teach rectitude; and fix my firm resolve</p>
<p class="t0">Wisdom to wed, and pay her long arrear:</p>
<p class="t0">Nor let the phial of thy vengeance, pour&rsquo;d</p>
<p class="t0">On this devoted head, be pour&rsquo;d in vain.</p>
<p class="t">The bell strikes one. We take no note of time</p>
<p class="t0">But from its loss. To give it then a tongue</p>
<p class="t0">Is wise in man. As if an angel spoke,</p>
<p class="t0">I feel the solemn sound. If heard aright,</p>
<p class="t0">It is the knell of my departed hours:</p>
<p class="t0">Where are they? With the years beyond the flood.<span class="lnum"> 60</span></p>
<p class="t0">It is the signal that demands despatch:</p>
<p class="t0">How much is to be done? My hopes and fears</p>
<p class="t0">Start up alarm&rsquo;d, and o&rsquo;er life&rsquo;s narrow verge</p>
<p class="t0">Look down&mdash;on what? a fathomless abyss;</p>
<p class="t0">A dread eternity! how surely mine!</p>
<p class="t0">And can eternity belong to me,</p>
<p class="t0">Poor pensioner on the bounties of an hour?</p>
<p class="t">How poor, how rich, how abject, how august,</p>
<p class="t0">How complicate, how wonderful, is man!</p>
<p class="t0">How passing wonder He who made him such!<span class="lnum"> 70</span></p>
<p class="t0">Who centred in our make such strange extremes!</p>
<p class="t0">From different natures marvellously mix&rsquo;d,</p>
<p class="t0">Connexion exquisite of distant worlds!</p>
<p class="t0">Distinguish&rsquo;d link in being&rsquo;s endless chain!</p>
<p class="t0">Midway from nothing to the Deity!</p>
<p class="t0">A beam ethereal, sullied and absorb&rsquo;d!</p>
<p class="t0">Though sullied and dishonour&rsquo;d, still divine!</p>
<p class="t0">Dim miniature of greatness absolute!</p>
<p class="t0">An heir of glory! a frail child of dust!</p>
<p class="t0">Helpless immortal! insect infinite!<span class="lnum"> 80</span></p>
<p class="t0">A worm! a god!&mdash;I tremble at myself,</p>
<p class="t0">And in myself am lost! At home a stranger,</p>
<p class="t0">Thought wanders up and down, surprised, aghast,<span class="lnum"> 83</span></p>
<p class="t0">And wondering at her own: how reason reels!</p>
<p class="t0">O what a miracle to man is man,</p>
<p class="t0">Triumphantly distress&rsquo;d! what joy, what dread!</p>
<p class="t0">Alternately transported and alarm&rsquo;d!</p>
<p class="t0">What can preserve my life, or what destroy?</p>
<p class="t0">An angel&rsquo;s arm can&rsquo;t snatch me from the grave;</p>
<p class="t0">Legions of angels can&rsquo;t confine me there.<span class="lnum"> 90</span></p>
<p class="t">&rsquo;Tis past conjecture; all things rise in proof:</p>
<p class="t0">While o&rsquo;er my limbs sleep&rsquo;s soft dominion spread,</p>
<p class="t0">What though my soul fantastic measures trod</p>
<p class="t0">O&rsquo;er fairy fields; or mourn&rsquo;d along the gloom</p>
<p class="t0">Of pathless woods; or down the craggy steep</p>
<p class="t0">Hurl&rsquo;d headlong, swam with pain the mantled pool;</p>
<p class="t0">Or scaled the cliff; or danced on hollow winds,</p>
<p class="t0">With antic shapes, wild natives of the brain?</p>
<p class="t0">Her ceaseless flight, though devious, speaks her nature</p>
<p class="t0">Of subtler essence than the trodden clod;<span class="lnum"> 100</span></p>
<p class="t0">Active, a&euml;rial, towering, unconfined,</p>
<p class="t0">Unfetter&rsquo;d with her gross companion&rsquo;s fall.</p>
<p class="t0">Even silent night proclaims my soul immortal:</p>
<p class="t0">Even silent night proclaims eternal day.</p>
<p class="t0">For human weal, Heaven husbands all events;</p>
<p class="t0">Dull sleep instructs, nor sport vain dreams in vain.</p>
<p class="t">Why then their loss deplore that are not lost?</p>
<p class="t0">Why wanders wretched thought their tombs around,</p>
<p class="t0">In infidel distress? Are angels there?</p>
<p class="t0">Slumbers, raked up in dust, ethereal fire?<span class="lnum"> 110</span></p>
<p class="t">They live! they greatly live a life on earth</p>
<p class="t0">Unkindled, unconceived; and from an eye</p>
<p class="t0">Of tenderness let heavenly pity fall</p>
<p class="t0">On me, more justly number&rsquo;d with the dead.</p>
<p class="t0">This is the desert, this the solitude:</p>
<p class="t0">How populous, how vital, is the grave!</p>
<p class="t0">This is creation&rsquo;s melancholy vault,<span class="lnum"> 117</span></p>
<p class="t0">The vale funereal, the sad cypress gloom;</p>
<p class="t0">The land of apparitions, empty shades!</p>
<p class="t0">All, all on earth, is shadow, all beyond</p>
<p class="t0">Is substance; the reverse is Folly&rsquo;s creed:</p>
<p class="t0">How solid all, where change shall be no more!</p>
<p class="t">This is the bud of being, the dim dawn,<span class="lnum"> 123</span></p>
<p class="t0">The twilight of our day, the vestibule;</p>
<p class="t0">Life&rsquo;s theatre as yet is shut, and death,</p>
<p class="t0">Strong death, alone can heave the massy bar,</p>
<p class="t0">This gross impediment of clay remove,</p>
<p class="t0">And make us embryos of existence free.</p>
<p class="t0">From real life, but little more remote</p>
<p class="t0">Is he, not yet a candidate for light,<span class="lnum"> 130</span></p>
<p class="t0">The future embryo, slumbering in his sire.</p>
<p class="t0">Embryos we must be, till we burst the shell,</p>

<p class="t">Yet man, fool man! here buries all his thoughts;</p>
<p class="t0">Inters celestial hopes without one sigh.</p>
<p class="t0">Prisoner of earth, and pent beneath the moon,</p>

<p class="t0">Wrapt up in triple brass, besiege mankind.</p>
<p class="t0">God&rsquo;s image disinherited of day,</p>
<p class="t0">Here, plunged in mines, forgets a sun was made.</p>
<p class="t0">There, beings deathless as their haughty lord,</p>
<p class="t0">Are hammer&rsquo;d to the galling oar for life;</p>
<p class="t0">And plough the winter&rsquo;s wave, and reap despair.</p>

<p class="t0">To shock us more, solicit it in vain!</p>
<p class="t0">Ye silken sons of pleasure! since in pains</p>

<p class="t0">Your impudence, you blush at what is right.</p>
<p class="t0">Happy, did sorrow seize on such alone!</p>

<p class="t0">Man&rsquo;s caution often into danger turns,</p>

<p class="t0">Not happiness itself makes good her name!</p>
<p class="t0">Our very wishes give us not our wish.</p>
<p class="t0">How distant oft the thing we doat on most,</p>

<p class="t0">The smoothest course of nature has its pains;</p>

<p class="t0">Without misfortune, what calamities!<span class="lnum"> 280</span></p>
<p class="t0">And what hostilities, without a foe!</p>
<p class="t0">Nor are foes wanting to the best on earth.</p>
<p class="t0">But endless is the list of human ills,</p>
<p class="t0">And sighs might sooner fail, than cause to sigh.</p>
<p class="t">A part how small of the terraqueous globe<span class="lnum"> 285</span></p>
<p class="t0">Is tenanted by man! the rest a waste,</p>
<p class="t0">Rocks, deserts, frozen seas, and burning sands:</p>
<p class="t0">Wild haunts of monsters, poisons, stings, and death.</p>
<p class="t0">Such is earth&rsquo;s melancholy map! But, far</p>
<p class="t0">More sad! this earth is a true map of man.</p>
<p class="t0">So bounded are its haughty lord&rsquo;s delights</p>
<p class="t0">To woe&rsquo;s wide empire; where deep troubles toss,</p>
<p class="t0">Loud sorrows howl, envenom&rsquo;d passions bite,<span class="lnum"> 293</span></p>
<p class="t0">Ravenous calamities our vitals seize,</p>
<p class="t0">And threatening fate wide opens to devour.</p>
<p class="t">What then am I, who sorrow for myself?</p>
<p class="t0">In age, in infancy, from others&rsquo; aid</p>

<p class="t0">Nor virtue, more than prudence, bids me give</p>
<p class="t0">Swoln thought a second channel; who divide,</p>

<p class="t0">Take then, O world! thy much-indebted tear:</p>

<p class="t0">To those whose thought can pierce beyond an hour!</p>
<p class="t0">O thou! whate&rsquo;er thou art, whose heart exults!</p>
<p class="t0">Would&rsquo;st thou I should congratulate thy fate?<span class="lnum"> 310</span></p>
<p class="t0">I know thou would&rsquo;st; thy pride demands it from me.</p>

<p class="t0">Thou happy wretch! by blindness thou art blest;</p>

<p class="t0">Dear is thy welfare; think me not unkind;</p>
<p class="t0">I would not damp, but to secure thy joys.</p>
<p class="t0">Think not that fear is sacred to the storm:</p>
<p class="t0">Stand on thy guard against the smiles of fate.</p>
<p class="t0">Is Heaven tremendous in its frowns? Most sure;</p>
<p class="t0">And in its favours formidable too:</p>
<p class="t0">Its favours here are trials, not rewards;<span class="lnum"> 330</span></p>
<p class="t0">A call to duty, not discharge from care;</p>
<p class="t0">And should alarm us, full as much as woes;</p>
<p class="t0">Awake us to their cause, and consequence;</p>
<p class="t0">O&rsquo;er our scann&rsquo;d conduct give a jealous eye,</p>
<p class="t0">And make us tremble, weigh&rsquo;d with our desert;</p>
<p class="t0">Awe nature&rsquo;s tumult, and chastise her joys,</p>
<p class="t0">Lest, while we clasp, we kill them; nay, invert</p>
<p class="t0">To worse than simple misery, their charms.</p>
<p class="t0">Revolted joys, like foes in civil war,</p>
<p class="t0">Like bosom friendships to resentment sour&rsquo;d,<span class="lnum"> 340</span></p>
<p class="t0">With rage envenom&rsquo;d rise against our peace.</p>

<p class="t0">Clouds thick as those on doomsday, drown the next;</p>

<p class="t">By nature&rsquo;s law, what may be, may be now;</p>
<p class="t0">There&rsquo;s no prerogative in human hours.</p>
<p class="t0">In human hearts what bolder thought can rise,</p>
<p class="t0">Than man&rsquo;s presumption on to-morrow&rsquo;s dawn!</p>
<p class="t0">Where is to-morrow? In another world.</p>
<p class="t0">For numbers this is certain; the reverse</p>
<p class="t0">Is sure to none; and yet on this perhaps,</p>
<p class="t0">This peradventure, infamous for lies,</p>
<p class="t0">As on a rock of adamant, we build<span class="lnum"> 380</span></p>
<p class="t0">Our mountain hopes; spin out eternal schemes,</p>

<p class="t">Not even Philander had bespoke his shroud;</p>
<p class="t0">Nor had he cause; a warning was denied.<span class="lnum"> 385</span></p>
<p class="t0">How many fall as sudden, not as safe!</p>
<p class="t0">As sudden, though for years admonish&rsquo;d home.</p>
<p class="t0">Of human ills the last extreme beware,</p>
<p class="t0">Beware, Lorenzo! a slow sudden death.</p>

<p class="t0">Next day the fatal precedent will plead;<span class="lnum"> 392</span></p>
<p class="t0">Thus on, till wisdom is push&rsquo;d out of life.</p>
<p class="t0">Procrastination is the thief of time;</p>
<p class="t0">Year after year it steals, till all are fled,</p>
<p class="t0">And to the mercies of a moment leaves</p>
<p class="t0">The vast concerns of an eternal scene.</p>
<p class="t0">If not so frequent, would not this be strange?</p>
<p class="t0">That &rsquo;tis so frequent, this is stranger still.</p>
<p class="t">Of man&rsquo;s miraculous mistakes, this bears<span class="lnum"> 400</span></p>
<p class="t0">The palm, &ldquo;That all men are about to live,&rdquo;</p>

<p class="t0">All promise is poor dilatory man,</p>
<p class="t0">And that through every stage: when young, indeed,</p>
<p class="t0">In full content we, sometimes, nobly rest,</p>
<p class="t0">Unanxious for ourselves; and only wish,</p>
<p class="t0">As duteous sons, our fathers were more wise.</p>
<p class="t0">At thirty, man suspects himself a fool;</p>
<p class="t0">Knows it at forty, and reforms his plan;<span class="lnum"> 419</span></p>
<p class="t0">At fifty, chides his infamous delay,</p>
<p class="t0">Pushes his prudent purpose to resolve;</p>
<p class="t0">In all the magnanimity of thought</p>
<p class="t0">Resolves; and re-resolves; then dies the same.</p>
<p class="t">And why? Because he thinks himself immortal.</p>
<p class="t0">All men think all men mortal, but themselves:</p>
<p class="t0">Themselves, when some alarming shock of fate</p>
<p class="t0">Strikes through their wounded hearts the sudden dread;</p>
<p class="t0">But their hearts wounded, like the wounded air,</p>
<p class="t0">Soon close; where pass&rsquo;d the shaft, no trace is found.</p>
<p class="t0">As from the wing no scar the sky retains;<span class="lnum"> 430</span></p>
<p class="t0">The parted wave no furrow from the keel;</p>
<p class="t0">So dies in human hearts the thought of death.</p>
<p class="t0">Even with the tender tear which nature sheds</p>
<p class="t0">O&rsquo;er those we love, we drop it in their grave.</p>
<p class="t0">Can I forget Philander? That were strange!</p>
<p class="t0">O my full heart!&mdash;&mdash;But should I give it vent,</p>

<p class="t0">A power ethereal, only not adored.</p>
<p class="t">Ah! how unjust to Nature, and himself,</p>
<p class="t0">Is thoughtless, thankless, inconsistent man!</p>
<p class="t0">Like children babbling nonsense in their sports,</p>
<p class="t0">We censure Nature for a span too short;</p>
<p class="t0">That span too short, we tax as tedious too;</p>
<p class="t0">Torture invention, all expedients tire,</p>
<p class="t0">To lash the lingering moments into speed,</p>
<p class="t0">And whirl us (happy riddance!) from ourselves.</p>
<p class="t0">Art, brainless Art! our furious charioteer<span class="lnum"> 120</span></p>
<p class="t0">(For Nature&rsquo;s voice unstifled would recall),</p>
<p class="t0">Drives headlong towards the precipice of death;<span class="lnum"> 122</span></p>
<p class="t0">Death, most our dread; death thus more dreadful made:</p>
<p class="t0">Oh, what a riddle of absurdity!</p>
<p class="t0">Leisure is pain; takes off our chariot wheels;</p>
<p class="t0">How heavily we drag the load of life!</p>
<p class="t0">Blest leisure is our curse; like that of Cain,</p>
<p class="t0">It makes us wander; wander earth around,</p>
<p class="t0">To fly that tyrant, thought. As Atlas groan&rsquo;d</p>
<p class="t0">The world beneath, we groan beneath an hour.<span class="lnum"> 130</span></p>
<p class="t0">We cry for mercy to the next amusement;</p>
<p class="t0">The next amusement mortgages our fields;</p>
<p class="t0">Slight inconvenience! prisons hardly frown,</p>
<p class="t0">From hateful time if prisons set us free.</p>
<p class="t0">Yet when Death kindly tenders us relief,</p>
<p class="t0">We call him cruel; years to moments shrink,</p>
<p class="t0">Ages to years. The telescope is turn&rsquo;d.</p>
<p class="t0">To man&rsquo;s false optics (from his folly false),</p>
<p class="t0">Time, in advance, behind him hides his wings,</p>
<p class="t0">And seems to creep, decrepit with his age;<span class="lnum"> 140</span></p>
<p class="t0">Behold him, when pass&rsquo;d by; what then is seen,</p>
<p class="t0">But his broad pinions swifter than the winds?</p>
<p class="t0">And all mankind, in contradiction strong,</p>
<p class="t0">Rueful, aghast! cry out on his career.</p>
<p class="t">Leave to thy foes these errors and these ills;</p>
<p class="t0">To Nature just, their cause and cure explore.</p>
<p class="t0">Not short Heaven&rsquo;s bounty, boundless our expence;</p>
<p class="t0">No niggard, Nature; men are prodigals.</p>
<p class="t0">We waste, not use our time; we breathe, not live.</p>
<p class="t0">Time wasted is existence, used is life.<span class="lnum"> 150</span></p>
<p class="t0">And bare existence, man, to live ordain&rsquo;d,</p>
<p class="t0">Wrings, and oppresses with enormous weight.</p>
<p class="t0">And why? since time was given for use, not waste,</p>
<p class="t0">Enjoin&rsquo;d to fly; with tempest, tide, and stars,</p>
<p class="t0">To keep his speed, nor ever wait for man;</p>
<p class="t0">Time&rsquo;s use was doom&rsquo;d a pleasure: waste, a pain;<span class="lnum"> 156</span></p>
<p class="t0">That man might feel his error, if unseen:</p>
<p class="t0">And, feeling, fly to labour for his cure;</p>
<p class="t0">Not, blundering, split on idleness for ease.</p>
<p class="t0">Life&rsquo;s cares are comforts; such by Heaven design&rsquo;d;</p>
<p class="t0">He that has none, must make them, or be wretched.</p>
<p class="t0">Cares are employments; and without employ</p>
<p class="t0">The soul is on a rack; the rack of rest,<span class="lnum"> 163</span></p>
<p class="t0">To souls most adverse; action all their joy.</p>
<p class="t">Here then, the riddle, mark&rsquo;d above, unfolds;</p>
<p class="t0">Then time turns torment, when man turns a fool.</p>
<p class="t0">We rave, we wrestle, with great Nature&rsquo;s plan;</p>
<p class="t0">We thwart the Deity; and &rsquo;tis decreed,</p>
<p class="t0">Who thwart his will shall contradict their own.</p>
<p class="t0">Hence our unnatural quarrels with ourselves;<span class="lnum"> 170</span></p>
<p class="t0">Our thoughts at enmity; our bosom-broils;</p>
<p class="t0">We push Time from us, and we wish him back;</p>
<p class="t0">Lavish of lustrums, and yet fond of life;</p>
<p class="t0">Life we think long, and short; death seek, and shun;</p>
<p class="t0">Body and soul, like peevish man and wife,</p>
<p class="t0">United jar, and yet are loth to part.</p>
<p class="t">Oh the dark days of vanity! while here,</p>
<p class="t0">How tasteless! and how terrible, when gone!</p>
<p class="t0">Gone! they ne&rsquo;er go; when past, they haunt us still;</p>
<p class="t0">The spirit walks of every day deceased;<span class="lnum"> 180</span></p>
<p class="t0">And smiles an angel, or a fury frowns.</p>
<p class="t0">Nor death, nor life delight us. If time past,</p>
<p class="t0">And time possess&rsquo;d, both pain us, what can please?</p>
<p class="t0">That which the Deity to please ordain&rsquo;d,</p>
<p class="t0">Time used. The man who consecrates his hours</p>
<p class="t0">By vigorous effort, and an honest aim,</p>
<p class="t0">At once he draws the sting of life and death;</p>
<p class="t0">He walks with Nature; and her paths are peace.</p>
<p class="t">Our error&rsquo;s cause and cure are seen: see next</p>
<p class="t0">Time&rsquo;s nature, origin, importance, speed;<span class="lnum"> 190</span></p>
<p class="t0">And thy great gain from urging his career.&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">All-sensual man, because untouch&rsquo;d, unseen,</p>
<p class="t0">He looks on time as nothing. Nothing else</p>
<p class="t0">Is truly man&rsquo;s; &rsquo;tis fortune&rsquo;s.&mdash;Time&rsquo;s a god.</p>
<p class="t0">Hast thou ne&rsquo;er heard of Time&rsquo;s omnipotence?</p>
<p class="t0">For, or against, what wonders he can do,</p>
<p class="t0">And will? To stand blank neuter he disdains.</p>
<p class="t0">Not on those terms was Time (Heaven&rsquo;s stranger!) sent</p>
<p class="t0">On his important embassy to man.</p>
<p class="t0">Lorenzo! no: on the long-destined hour,<span class="lnum"> 200</span></p>
<p class="t0">From everlasting ages growing ripe,</p>
<p class="t0">That memorable hour of wondrous birth,</p>
<p class="t0">When the Dread Sire, on emanation bent,</p>
<p class="t0">And big with Nature, rising in his might,</p>
<p class="t0">Call&rsquo;d forth creation (for then Time was born),</p>
<p class="t0">By Godhead streaming through a thousand worlds;</p>
<p class="t0">Not on those terms, from the great days of heaven,</p>
<p class="t0">From old Eternity&rsquo;s mysterious orb,</p>
<p class="t0">Was Time cut off, and cast beneath the skies;</p>
<p class="t0">The skies, which watch him in his new abode,<span class="lnum"> 210</span></p>
<p class="t0">Measuring his motions by revolving spheres;</p>
<p class="t0">That horologe machinery divine.</p>
<p class="t0">Hours, days, and months, and years, his children play,</p>
<p class="t0">Like numerous wings around him, as he flies:</p>
<p class="t0">Or, rather, as unequal plumes, they shape</p>
<p class="t0">His ample pinions, swift as darted flame,</p>
<p class="t0">To gain his goal, to reach his ancient rest,</p>
<p class="t0">And join anew Eternity his sire;</p>
<p class="t0">In his immutability to nest,</p>
<p class="t0">When worlds, that count his circles now, unhinged<span class="lnum"> 220</span></p>
<p class="t0">(Fate the loud signal sounding), headlong rush</p>
<p class="t0">To timeless night and chaos, whence they rose.</p>
<p class="t">Why spur the speedy? why with levities</p>
<p class="t0">New wing thy short, short day&rsquo;s too rapid flight?<span class="lnum"> 224</span></p>
<p class="t0">Know&rsquo;st thou, or what thou dost, or what is done?</p>
<p class="t0">Man flies from time, and time from man; too soon</p>
<p class="t0">In sad divorce this double flight must end:</p>
<p class="t0">And then where are we? where, Lorenzo! then</p>
<p class="t0">Thy sports? thy pomps?&mdash;I grant thee, in a state</p>
<p class="t0">Not unambitious; in the ruffled shroud,</p>
<p class="t0">Thy Parian tomb&rsquo;s triumphant arch beneath.</p>
<p class="t0">Has Death his fopperies? Then well may life<span class="lnum"> 232</span></p>
<p class="t0">Put on her plume, and in her rainbow shine.</p>
<p class="t0">Ye well-array&rsquo;d! ye lilies of our land!</p>
<p class="t0">Ye lilies male! who neither toil nor spin</p>
<p class="t0">(As sister lilies might), if not so wise</p>
<p class="t0">As Solomon, more sumptuous to the sight!</p>
<p class="t0">Ye delicate! who nothing can support,</p>
<p class="t0">Yourselves most insupportable! for whom</p>
<p class="t0">The winter rose must blow, the sun put on<span class="lnum"> 240</span></p>
<p class="t0">A brighter beam in Leo; silky-soft</p>
<p class="t0">Favonius breathe still softer, or be chid;</p>
<p class="t0">And other worlds send odours, sauce, and song,</p>
<p class="t0">And robes, and notions, framed in foreign looms!</p>
<p class="t0">O ye Lorenzos of our age! who deem</p>
<p class="t0">One moment unamused, a misery</p>
<p class="t0">Not made for feeble man! who call aloud</p>
<p class="t0">For every bauble drivell&rsquo;d o&rsquo;er by sense;</p>
<p class="t0">For rattles, and conceits of every cast,</p>
<p class="t0">For change of follies, and relays of joy,<span class="lnum"> 250</span></p>
<p class="t0">To drag your patient through the tedious length</p>
<p class="t0">Of a short winter&rsquo;s day&mdash;say, sages! say,</p>
<p class="t0">Wit&rsquo;s oracles! say, dreamers of gay dreams!</p>
<p class="t0">How will you weather an eternal night,</p>
<p class="t0">Where such expedients fail?</p>
<p class="t">O treacherous Conscience! while she seems to sleep</p>
<p class="t0">On rose and myrtle, lull&rsquo;d with syren song;</p>
<p class="t0">While she seems, nodding o&rsquo;er her charge, to drop<span class="lnum"> 258</span></p>
<p class="t0">On headlong appetite the slacken&rsquo;d rein,</p>
<p class="t0">And give us up to licence, unrecall&rsquo;d,</p>
<p class="t0">Unmark&rsquo;d;&mdash;see, from behind her secret stand,</p>
<p class="t0">The sly informer minutes every fault,</p>
<p class="t0">And her dread diary with horror fills.</p>
<p class="t0">Not the gross act alone employs her pen;</p>
<p class="t0">She reconnoitres fancy&rsquo;s airy band,</p>
<p class="t0">A watchful foe! the formidable spy,</p>
<p class="t0">Listening, o&rsquo;erhears the whispers of our camp:</p>
<p class="t0">Our dawning purposes of heart explores,</p>
<p class="t0">And steals our embryos of iniquity.</p>
<p class="t0">As all-rapacious usurers conceal<span class="lnum"> 270</span></p>
<p class="t0">Their doomsday-book from all-consuming heirs;</p>
<p class="t0">Thus, with indulgence most severe, she treats</p>
<p class="t0">Us spendthrifts of inestimable time;</p>
<p class="t0">Unnoted, notes each moment misapplied;</p>
<p class="t0">In leaves more durable than leaves of brass,</p>
<p class="t0">Writes our whole history; which Death shall read</p>
<p class="t0">In every pale delinquent&rsquo;s private ear;</p>
<p class="t0">And Judgment publish; publish to more worlds</p>
<p class="t0">Than this; and endless age in groans resound.</p>
<p class="t0">Lorenzo, such that sleeper in thy breast!<span class="lnum"> 280</span></p>
<p class="t0">Such is her slumber; and her vengeance such</p>
<p class="t0">For slighted counsel; such thy future peace!</p>
<p class="t0">And think&rsquo;st thou still thou canst be wise too soon?</p>
<p class="t">But why on Time so lavish is my song?</p>
<p class="t0">On this great theme kind Nature keeps a school,</p>
<p class="t0">To teach her sons herself. Each night we die,</p>
<p class="t0">Each morn are born anew: each day, a life!</p>
<p class="t0">And shall we kill each day? If trifling kills;</p>
<p class="t0">Sure vice must butcher. Oh, what heaps of slain</p>
<p class="t0">Cry out for vengeance on us! Time destroy&rsquo;d<span class="lnum"> 290</span></p>
<p class="t0">Is suicide, where more than blood is spilt.</p>
<p class="t0">Time flies, Death urges, knells call, Heaven invites,<span class="lnum"> 292</span></p>
<p class="t0">Hell threatens: all exerts; in effort, all;</p>
<p class="t0">More than creation labours!&mdash;labours more?</p>
<p class="t0">And is there in creation what, amidst</p>
<p class="t0">This tumult universal, wing&rsquo;d despatch,</p>
<p class="t0">And ardent energy, supinely yawns?&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">Man sleeps; and man alone; and man, whose fate,</p>
<p class="t0">Fate irreversible, entire, extreme,</p>
<p class="t0">Endless, hair-hung, breeze-shaken, o&rsquo;er the gulf<span class="lnum"> 300</span></p>
<p class="t0">A moment trembles; drops! and man, for whom</p>
<p class="t0">All else is in alarm! man, the sole cause</p>
<p class="t0">Of this surrounding storm! and yet he sleeps,</p>
<p class="t0">As the storm rock&rsquo;d to rest.&mdash;Throw years away?</p>
<p class="t0">Throw empires, and be blameless. Moments seize;</p>
<p class="t0">Heaven&rsquo;s on their wing: a moment we may wish,</p>
<p class="t0">When worlds want wealth to buy. Bid Day stand still,</p>
<p class="t0">Bid him drive back his car, and re-import</p>
<p class="t0">The period past, re-give the given hour.</p>
<p class="t0">Lorenzo, more than miracles we want;<span class="lnum"> 310</span></p>
<p class="t0">Lorenzo&mdash;O for yesterdays to come!</p>
<p class="t">Such is the language of the man awake;</p>
<p class="t0">His ardour such, for what oppresses thee.</p>
<p class="t0">And is his ardour vain, Lorenzo? No;</p>
<p class="t0">That more than miracle the gods indulge;</p>
<p class="t0">To-day is yesterday return&rsquo;d; return&rsquo;d</p>
<p class="t0">Full power&rsquo;d to cancel, expiate, raise, adorn,</p>
<p class="t0">And reinstate us on the rock of peace.</p>
<p class="t0">Let it not share its predecessor&rsquo;s fate;</p>
<p class="t0">Nor, like its elder sisters, die a fool.<span class="lnum"> 320</span></p>
<p class="t0">Shall it evaporate in fume? fly off</p>
<p class="t0">Fuliginous, and stain us deeper still?</p>
<p class="t0">Shall we be poorer for the plenty pour&rsquo;d?</p>
<p class="t0">More wretched for the clemencies of Heaven?</p>
<p class="t">Where shall I find him? Angels! tell me where.</p>
<p class="t0">You know him: he is near you: point him out:<span class="lnum"> 326</span></p>
<p class="t0">Shall I see glories beaming from his brow?</p>
<p class="t0">Or trace his footsteps by the rising flowers?</p>
<p class="t0">Your golden wings, now hovering o&rsquo;er him, shed</p>
<p class="t0">Protection; now, are waving in applause</p>
<p class="t0">To that bless&rsquo;d son of foresight! lord of fate!</p>
<p class="t0">That awful independent on to-morrow!</p>
<p class="t0">Whose work is done; who triumphs in the past;<span class="lnum"> 333</span></p>
<p class="t0">Whose yesterdays look backwards with a smile;</p>
<p class="t0">Nor, like the Parthian, wound him as they fly;</p>
<p class="t0">That common but opprobrious lot! past hours,</p>
<p class="t0">If not by guilt, yet wound us by their flight,</p>
<p class="t0">If folly bounds our prospect by the grave,</p>
<p class="t0">All feeling of futurity benumb&rsquo;d;</p>
<p class="t0">All god-like passion for eternals quench&rsquo;d;<span class="lnum"> 340</span></p>
<p class="t0">All relish of realities expired;</p>
<p class="t0">Renounced all correspondence with the skies;</p>
<p class="t0">Our freedom chain&rsquo;d; quite wingless our desire;</p>
<p class="t0">In sense dark-prison&rsquo;d all that ought to soar;</p>
<p class="t0">Prone to the centre; crawling in the dust;</p>
<p class="t0">Dismounted every great and glorious aim;</p>
<p class="t0">Embruted every faculty divine;</p>
<p class="t0">Heart-buried in the rubbish of the world.</p>
<p class="t0">The world, that gulf of souls, immortal souls,</p>
<p class="t0">Souls elevate, angelic, wing&rsquo;d with fire<span class="lnum"> 350</span></p>
<p class="t0">To reach the distant skies, and triumph there</p>
<p class="t0">On thrones, which shall not mourn their masters changed,</p>
<p class="t0">Though we from earth; ethereal, they that fell.</p>
<p class="t0">Such veneration due, O man, to man.</p>
<p class="t">Who venerate themselves, the world despise.</p>
<p class="t0">For what, gay friend! is this escutcheon&rsquo;d world,</p>
<p class="t0">Which hangs out death in one eternal night?</p>
<p class="t0">A night, that glooms us in the noontide ray,</p>
<p class="t0">And wraps our thought, at banquets, in the shroud.</p>
<p class="t0">Life&rsquo;s little stage is a small eminence,<span class="lnum"> 360</span></p>
<p class="t0">Inch-high the grave above; that home of man,</p>
<p class="t0">Where dwells the multitude: we gaze around;</p>
<p class="t0">We read their monuments; we sigh; and while</p>
<p class="t0">We sigh, we sink; and are what we deplored;</p>
<p class="t0">Lamenting, or lamented, all our lot!</p>
<p class="t">Is Death at distance? No: he has been on thee;</p>
<p class="t0">And given sure earnest of his final blow.</p>
<p class="t0">These hours that lately smiled, where are they now?</p>
<p class="t0">Pallid to thought, and ghastly! drown&rsquo;d, all drown&rsquo;d</p>
<p class="t0">In that great deep, which nothing disembogues!<span class="lnum"> 370</span></p>
<p class="t0">And, dying, they bequeathed thee small renown.</p>
<p class="t0">The rest are on the wing: how fleet their flight!</p>
<p class="t0">Already has the fatal train took fire;</p>
<p class="t0">A moment, and the world&rsquo;s blown up to thee;</p>
<p class="t0">The sun is darkness, and the stars are dust.</p>
<p class="t">&rsquo;Tis greatly wise to talk with our past hours;</p>
<p class="t0">And ask them, what report they bore to heaven;</p>
<p class="t0">And how they might have borne more welcome news.</p>
<p class="t0">Their answers form what men experience call;</p>
<p class="t0">If Wisdom&rsquo;s friend, her best; if not, worst foe.<span class="lnum"> 380</span></p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Oh, reconcile them!&rdquo; kind Experience cries;</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing here, but what as nothing weighs;</p>
<p class="t0">The more our joy, the more we know it vain;</p>
<p class="t0">And by success are tutor&rsquo;d to despair.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">Nor is it only thus, but must be so.</p>
<p class="t0">Who knows not this, though grey, is still a child.</p>
<p class="t0">Loose then from earth the grasp of fond desire,</p>
<p class="t0">Weigh anchor, and some happier clime explore.</p>
<p class="t">Art thou so moor&rsquo;d thou canst not disengage,</p>
<p class="t0">Nor give thy thoughts a ply to future scenes?<span class="lnum"> 390</span></p>
<p class="t0">Since, by life&rsquo;s passing breath, blown up from earth,</p>
<p class="t0">Light as the summer&rsquo;s dust, we take in air</p>
<p class="t0">A moment&rsquo;s giddy flight, and fall again;</p>
<p class="t0">Join the dull mass, increase the trodden soil,<span class="lnum"> 394</span></p>
<p class="t0">And sleep, till earth herself shall be no more;</p>
<p class="t0">Since then (as emmets, their small world o&rsquo;erthrown)</p>
<p class="t0">We, sore-amazed, from out earth&rsquo;s ruins crawl,</p>
<p class="t0">And rise to fate extreme of foul or fair,</p>
<p class="t0">As man&rsquo;s own choice (controller of the skies!)</p>
<p class="t0">As man&rsquo;s despotic will, perhaps one hour</p>
<p class="t0">(O how omnipotent is time!) decrees;</p>
<p class="t0">Should not each warning give a strong alarm?</p>
<p class="t0">Warning, far less than that of bosom torn<span class="lnum"> 403</span></p>
<p class="t0">From bosom, bleeding o&rsquo;er the sacred dead!</p>
<p class="t0">Should not each dial strike us as we pass,</p>
<p class="t0">Portentous, as the written wall, which struck,</p>
<p class="t0">O&rsquo;er midnight bowls, the proud Assyrian pale,</p>
<p class="t0">Erewhile high-flush&rsquo;d, with insolence, and wine?</p>
<p class="t0">Like that, the dial speaks; and points to thee,</p>
<p class="t0">Lorenzo! loth to break thy banquet up:<span class="lnum"> 410</span></p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;O man, thy kingdom is departing from thee;</p>
<p class="t0">And, while it lasts, is emptier than my shade.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">Its silent language such: nor need&rsquo;st thou call</p>
<p class="t0">Thy Magi, to decipher what it means.</p>
<p class="t0">Know, like the Median, fate is in thy walls:</p>
<p class="t0">Dost ask, How? Whence? Belshazzar-like, amazed?</p>
<p class="t0">Man&rsquo;s make encloses the sure seeds of death;</p>
<p class="t0">Life feeds the murderer: ingrate! he thrives</p>
<p class="t0">On her own meal, and then his nurse devours.</p>
<p class="t">But, here, Lorenzo, the delusion lies;<span class="lnum"> 420</span></p>
<p class="t0">That solar shadow, as it measures life,</p>
<p class="t0">It life resembles too: life speeds away</p>
<p class="t0">From point to point, though seeming to stand still.</p>
<p class="t0">The cunning fugitive is swift by stealth:</p>
<p class="t0">Too subtle is the movement to be seen;</p>
<p class="t0">Yet soon man&rsquo;s hour is up, and we are gone.</p>
<p class="t0">Warnings point out our danger; gnomons, time:</p>
<p class="t0">As these are useless when the sun is set:<span class="lnum"> 423</span></p>
<p class="t0">So those, but when more glorious reason shines.</p>
<p class="t0">Reason should judge in all; in reason&rsquo;s eye,</p>
<p class="t0">That sedentary shadow travels hard.</p>
<p class="t0">But such our gravitation to the wrong,</p>
<p class="t0">So prone our hearts to whisper what we wish,</p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Tis later with the wise than he&rsquo;s aware:</p>
<p class="t0">A Wilmington goes slower than the sun:</p>
<p class="t0">And all mankind mistake their time of day;</p>
<p class="t0">Even age itself. Fresh hopes are hourly sown</p>
<p class="t0">In furrow&rsquo;d brows. To gentle life&rsquo;s descent</p>
<p class="t0">We shut our eyes, and think it is a plain.</p>
<p class="t0">We take fair days in winter, for the spring;<span class="lnum"> 440</span></p>
<p class="t0">And turn our blessings into bane. Since oft</p>
<p class="t0">Man must compute that age he cannot feel,</p>
<p class="t0">He scarce believes he&rsquo;s older for his years.</p>
<p class="t0">Thus, at life&rsquo;s latest eve, we keep in store</p>
<p class="t0">One disappointment sure, to crown the rest;</p>
<p class="t0">The disappointment of a promised hour.</p>
<p class="t">On this, or similar, Philander! thou,</p>
<p class="t0">Whose mind was moral, as the preacher&rsquo;s tongue;</p>

<p class="t0">Thoughts disentangle passing o&rsquo;er the lip;</p>
<p class="t0">Clean runs the thread; if not, &rsquo;tis thrown away,</p>

<p class="t">Know&rsquo;st thou, Lorenzo! what a friend contains?<span class="lnum"> 461</span></p>
<p class="t0">As bees mix&rsquo;d nectar draw from fragrant flowers,</p>
<p class="t0">So men from friendship, wisdom and delight;</p>
<p class="t0">Twins tied by Nature, if they part, they die.</p>
<p class="t0">Hast thou no friend to set thy mind abroach?</p>
<p class="t0">Good sense will stagnate. Thoughts shut up, want air,</p>
<p class="t0">And spoil, like bales unopen&rsquo;d to the sun.</p>
<p class="t0">Had thought been all, sweet speech had been denied;</p>
<p class="t0">Speech, thought&rsquo;s canal! speech, thought&rsquo;s criterion too!</p>
<p class="t0">Thought in the mine, may come forth gold, or dross;</p>
<p class="t0">When coin&rsquo;d in words, we know its real worth.<span class="lnum"> 471</span></p>
<p class="t0">If sterling, store it for thy future use;</p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Twill buy thee benefit; perhaps, renown.</p>
<p class="t0">Thought, too, deliver&rsquo;d, is the more possess&rsquo;d;</p>
<p class="t0">Teaching, we learn; and, giving, we retain</p>
<p class="t0">The births of intellect; when dumb, forgot.</p>
<p class="t0">Speech ventilates our intellectual fire;</p>
<p class="t0">Speech burnishes our mental magazine;</p>
<p class="t0">Brightens, for ornament; and whets, for use.</p>
<p class="t0">What numbers, sheathed in erudition, lie,<span class="lnum"> 480</span></p>
<p class="t0">Plunged to the hilts in venerable tomes,</p>
<p class="t0">And rusted in; who might have borne an edge,</p>
<p class="t0">And play&rsquo;d a sprightly beam, if born to speech;</p>
<p class="t0">If born bless&rsquo;d heirs of half their mother&rsquo;s tongue!</p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Tis thought&rsquo;s exchange, which, like th&rsquo; alternate push</p>
<p class="t0">Of waves conflicting, breaks the learned scum,</p>
<p class="t0">And defecates the student&rsquo;s standing pool.</p>
<p class="t">In contemplation is his proud resource?</p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Tis poor, as proud, by converse unsustain&rsquo;d.</p>
<p class="t0">Rude thought runs wild in contemplation&rsquo;s field;<span class="lnum"> 490</span></p>
<p class="t0">Converse, the menage, breaks it to the bit</p>
<p class="t0">Of due restraint; and emulation&rsquo;s spur</p>
<p class="t0">Gives graceful energy, by rivals awed.</p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Tis converse qualifies for solitude;</p>
<p class="t0">As exercise, for salutary rest.<span class="lnum"> 495</span></p>
<p class="t0">By that untutor&rsquo;d, contemplation raves;</p>
<p class="t0">And Nature&rsquo;s fool, by wisdom is undone.</p>
<p class="t">Wisdom, though richer than Peruvian mines,</p>
<p class="t0">And sweeter than the sweet ambrosial hive,</p>
<p class="t0">What is she, but the means of happiness?</p>
<p class="t0">That unobtain&rsquo;d, than folly more a fool;</p>
<p class="t0">A melancholy fool, without her bells.</p>
<p class="t0">Friendship, the means of wisdom, richly gives<span class="lnum"> 503</span></p>
<p class="t0">The precious end, which makes our wisdom wise.</p>
<p class="t0">Nature, in zeal for human amity,</p>
<p class="t0">Denies, or damps, an undivided joy.</p>
<p class="t0">Joy is an import; joy is an exchange;</p>
<p class="t0">Joy flies monopolists: it calls for two;</p>
<p class="t0">Rich fruit! heaven-planted! never pluck&rsquo;d by one.</p>
<p class="t0">Needful auxiliars are our friends, to give<span class="lnum"> 510</span></p>
<p class="t0">To social man true relish of himself.</p>
<p class="t0">Full on ourselves, descending in a line,</p>
<p class="t0">Pleasure&rsquo;s bright beam is feeble in delight:</p>
<p class="t0">Delight intense, is taken by rebound;</p>
<p class="t0">Reverberated pleasures fire the breast.</p>
<p class="t">Celestial happiness, whene&rsquo;er she stoops</p>
<p class="t0">To visit earth, one shrine the goddess finds,</p>
<p class="t0">And one alone, to make her sweet amends</p>
<p class="t0">For absent heaven&mdash;the bosom of a friend;</p>
<p class="t0">Where heart meets heart, reciprocally soft,<span class="lnum"> 520</span></p>
<p class="t0">Each other&rsquo;s pillow to repose divine.</p>
<p class="t0">Beware the counterfeit: in passion&rsquo;s flame</p>
<p class="t0">Hearts melt, but melt like ice, soon harder froze.</p>
<p class="t0">True love strikes root in reason; passion&rsquo;s foe:</p>
<p class="t0">Virtue alone entenders us for life:</p>
<p class="t0">I wrong her much&mdash;entenders us for ever:</p>
<p class="t0">Of friendship&rsquo;s fairest fruits, the fruit most fair</p>
<p class="t0">Is virtue kindling at a rival fire,</p>
<p class="t0">And, emulously, rapid in her race.<span class="lnum"> 529</span></p>
<p class="t0">O the soft enmity! endearing strife!</p>
<p class="t0">This carries friendship to her noontide point,</p>
<p class="t0">And gives the rivet of eternity.</p>
<p class="t">From friendship, which outlives my former themes,</p>
<p class="t0">Glorious survivor of old time and death;</p>
<p class="t0">From friendship, thus, that flower of heavenly seed,</p>
<p class="t0">The wise extract earth&rsquo;s most Hyblean bliss,</p>
<p class="t0">Superior wisdom, crown&rsquo;d with smiling joy.</p>
<p class="t">But for whom blossoms this Elysian flower?</p>
<p class="t0">Abroad they find, who cherish it at home.</p>
<p class="t0">Lorenzo! pardon what my love extorts,<span class="lnum"> 540</span></p>
<p class="t0">An honest love, and not afraid to frown.</p>
<p class="t0">Though choice of follies fasten on the great,</p>
<p class="t0">None clings more obstinate, than fancy, fond</p>
<p class="t0">That sacred friendship is their easy prey;</p>
<p class="t0">Caught by the wafture of a golden lure,</p>
<p class="t0">Or fascination of a high-born smile.</p>
<p class="t0">Their smiles, the great, and the coquette, throw out</p>
<p class="t0">For others&rsquo; hearts, tenacious of their own;</p>
<p class="t0">And we no less of ours, when such the bait.</p>
<p class="t0">Ye fortune&rsquo;s cofferers! ye powers of wealth!<span class="lnum"> 550</span></p>
<p class="t0">Can gold gain friendship? Impudence of hope!</p>
<p class="t0">As well mere man an angel might beget.</p>
<p class="t0">Love, and love only, is the loan for love.</p>
<p class="t0">Lorenzo! pride repress; nor hope to find</p>
<p class="t0">A friend, but what has found a friend in thee.</p>
<p class="t0">All like the purchase; few the price will pay;</p>
<p class="t0">And this makes friends such miracles below.</p>
<p class="t">What if (since daring on so nice a theme)</p>
<p class="t0">I show thee friendship delicate, as dear,</p>
<p class="t0">Of tender violations apt to die?<span class="lnum"> 560</span></p>
<p class="t0">Reserve will wound it; and distrust, destroy.</p>
<p class="t0">Deliberate on all things with thy friend.</p>
<p class="t0">But since friends grow not thick on every bough,<span class="lnum"> 563</span></p>
<p class="t0">Nor every friend unrotten at the core;</p>
<p class="t0">First, on thy friend, deliberate with thyself;</p>
<p class="t0">Pause, ponder, sift; not eager in the choice,</p>
<p class="t0">Nor jealous of the chosen; fixing, fix;</p>
<p class="t0">Judge before friendship, then confide till death.</p>
<p class="t0">Well, for thy friend; but nobler far for thee;</p>
<p class="t0">How gallant danger for earth&rsquo;s highest prize!<span class="lnum"> 570</span></p>
<p class="t0">A friend is worth all hazards we can run.</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Poor is the friendless master of a world:</p>
<p class="t0">A world in purchase for a friend is gain.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t">So sung he (angels hear that angel sing!</p>
<p class="t0">Angels from friendship gather half their joy),</p>
<p class="t0">So sung Philander, as his friend went round</p>
<p class="t0">In the rich ichor, in the generous blood</p>
<p class="t0">Of Bacchus, purple god of joyous wit,</p>
<p class="t0">A brow solute, and ever-laughing eye.</p>
<p class="t0">He drank long health, and virtue, to his friend;<span class="lnum"> 580</span></p>
<p class="t0">His friend, who warm&rsquo;d him more, who more inspired.</p>
<p class="t0">Friendship&rsquo;s the wine of life; but friendship new</p>
<p class="t0">(Not such was his) is neither strong, nor pure.</p>
<p class="t0">O for the bright complexion, cordial warmth,</p>
<p class="t0">And elevating spirit, of a friend,</p>
<p class="t0">For twenty summers ripening by my side;</p>
<p class="t0">All feculence of falsehood long thrown down;</p>
<p class="t0">All social virtues rising in his soul;</p>
<p class="t0">As crystal clear; and smiling, as they rise!</p>
<p class="t0">Here nectar flows; it sparkles in our sight;<span class="lnum"> 590</span></p>
<p class="t0">Rich to the taste, and genuine from the heart.</p>
<p class="t0">High-flavour&rsquo;d bliss for gods! on earth how rare!</p>
<p class="t0">On earth how lost!&mdash;Philander is no more.</p>
<p class="t">Think&rsquo;st thou the theme intoxicates my song?</p>
<p class="t0">Am I too warm?&mdash;Too warm I cannot be.</p>
<p class="t0">I loved him much; but now I love him more.</p>
<p class="t0">Like birds, whose beauties languish, half-conceal&rsquo;d,<span class="lnum"> 597</span></p>
<p class="t0">Till, mounted on the wing, their glossy plumes</p>
<p class="t0">Expanded shine with azure, green, and gold;</p>
<p class="t0">How blessings brighten as they take their flight!</p>
<p class="t0">His flight Philander took; his upward flight,</p>
<p class="t0">If ever soul ascended. Had he dropp&rsquo;d</p>
<p class="t0">(That eagle genius!), oh! had he let fall</p>
<p class="t0">One feather as he flew; I, then, had wrote,<span class="lnum"> 604</span></p>
<p class="t0">What friends might flatter; prudent foes forbear;</p>
<p class="t0">Rivals scarce damn; and Zoilus reprieve.</p>
<p class="t0">Yet what I can, I must: it were profane</p>
<p class="t0">To quench a glory lighted at the skies,</p>
<p class="t0">And cast in shadows his illustrious close.</p>
<p class="t0">Strange! the theme most affecting, most sublime,<span class="lnum"> 610</span></p>
<p class="t0">Momentous most to man, should sleep unsung!</p>
<p class="t0">And yet it sleeps, by genius unawaked,</p>
<p class="t0">Paynim or Christian; to the blush of wit.</p>
<p class="t0">Man&rsquo;s highest triumph! man&rsquo;s profoundest fall!</p>
<p class="t0">The death-bed of the just! is yet undrawn</p>
<p class="t0">By mortal hand; it merits a divine:</p>
<p class="t0">Angels should paint it, angels ever there;</p>
<p class="t0">There, on a post of honour, and of joy.</p>
<p class="t">Dare I presume, then? But Philander bids;</p>
<p class="t0">And glory tempts, and inclination calls&mdash;<span class="lnum"> 620</span></p>
<p class="t0">Yet am I struck; as struck the soul, beneath</p>
<p class="t0">A&euml;rial groves&rsquo; impenetrable gloom;</p>
<p class="t0">Or, in some mighty ruin&rsquo;s solemn shade;</p>
<p class="t0">Or, gazing by pale lamps on high-born dust,</p>
<p class="t0">In vaults; thin courts of poor unflatter&rsquo;d kings;</p>
<p class="t0">Or, at the midnight altar&rsquo;s hallow&rsquo;d flame.</p>
<p class="t0">Is it religion to proceed? I pause&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">And enter, awed, the temple of my theme.</p>
<p class="t0">Is it his death-bed? No: it is his shrine:</p>
<p class="t0">Behold him, there, just rising to a god.<span class="lnum"> 630</span></p>
<p class="t">The chamber where the good man meets his fate,<span class="lnum"> 631</span></p>
<p class="t0">Is privileged beyond the common walk</p>
<p class="t0">Of virtuous life, quite in the verge of heaven.</p>
<p class="t0">Fly, ye profane! if not, draw near with awe,</p>
<p class="t0">Receive the blessing, and adore the chance,</p>
<p class="t0">That threw in this Bethesda your disease;</p>
<p class="t0">If unrestored by this, despair your cure.</p>
<p class="t0">For here, resistless demonstration dwells;</p>
<p class="t0">A death-bed&rsquo;s a detector of the heart.</p>

<p class="t0">Through life&rsquo;s grimace, that mistress of the scene!</p>
<p class="t0">Here real and apparent are the same.</p>
<p class="t0">You see the man; you see his hold on heaven;</p>
<p class="t0">If sound his virtue; as Philander&rsquo;s, sound.</p>
<p class="t0">Heaven waits not the last moment; owns her friends</p>
<p class="t0">On this side death; and points them out to men,</p>
<p class="t0">A lecture, silent, but of sovereign power!</p>
<p class="t0">To vice, confusion; and to virtue, peace.</p>
<p class="t">Whatever farce the boastful hero plays,</p>
<p class="t0">Virtue alone has majesty in death;<span class="lnum"> 650</span></p>
<p class="t0">And greater still, the more the tyrant frowns.</p>

<p class="t">Our dying friends come o&rsquo;er us like a cloud,</p>

<p class="t0">Dark in herself, and indigent; but rich</p>
<p class="t0">In borrow&rsquo;d lustre from a higher sphere.</p>
<p class="t0">When gross guilt interposes, labouring earth,</p>
<p class="t0">O&rsquo;ershadow&rsquo;d, mourns a deep eclipse of joy;</p>
<p class="t0">Her joys, at brightest, pallid, to that font</p>
<p class="t0">Of full effulgent glory, whence they flow.<span class="lnum"> 430</span></p>
<p class="t">Nor is that glory distant: Oh, Lorenzo!</p>
<p class="t0">A good man, and an angel! these between</p>
<p class="t0">How thin the barrier! What divides their fate?</p>
<p class="t0">Perhaps a moment, or perhaps a year:</p>
<p class="t0">Or, if an age, it is a moment still;</p>
<p class="t0">A moment, or eternity&rsquo;s forgot.</p>
<p class="t0">Then be, what once they were, who now are gods;</p>
<p class="t0">Be what Philander was, and claim the skies.</p>
<p class="t0">Starts timid nature at the gloomy pass?</p>
<p class="t0">The soft transition call it; and be cheer&rsquo;d:<span class="lnum"> 440</span></p>
<p class="t0">Such it is often, and why not to thee?</p>
<p class="t0">To hope the best, is pious, brave, and wise;</p>
<p class="t0">And may itself procure, what it presumes.</p>
<p class="t0">Life is much flatter&rsquo;d, death is much traduced;</p>
<p class="t0">Compare the rivals, and the kinder crown.</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Strange competition!&rdquo;&mdash;True, Lorenzo! strange!</p>
<p class="t0">So little life can cast into the scale.</p>
<p class="t">Life makes the soul dependent on the dust;</p>
<p class="t0">Death gives her wings to mount above the spheres.</p>
<p class="t0">Through chinks, styled organs, dim life peeps at light;</p>
<p class="t0">Death bursts th&rsquo; involving cloud, and all is day;<span class="lnum"> 451</span></p>
<p class="t0">All eye, all ear, the disembodied power.</p>
<p class="t0">Death has feign&rsquo;d evils, nature shall not feel;</p>
<p class="t0">Life, ills substantial, wisdom cannot shun.</p>
<p class="t0">Is not the mighty mind, that son of heaven!</p>
<p class="t0">By tyrant life dethroned, imprison&rsquo;d, pain&rsquo;d?</p>
<p class="t0">By death enlarged, ennobled, deified?<span class="lnum"> 457</span></p>
<p class="t0">Death but entombs the body; life the soul.</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Is Death then guiltless? How he marks his way</p>
<p class="t0">With dreadful waste of what deserves to shine!</p>
<p class="t0">Art, genius, fortune, elevated power!</p>
<p class="t0">With various lustres these light up the world,</p>
<p class="t0">Which Death puts out, and darkens human race.&rdquo;<span class="lnum"> 463</span></p>
<p class="t0">I grant, Lorenzo! this indictment just:</p>
<p class="t0">The sage, peer, potentate, king, conqueror!</p>
<p class="t0">Death humbles these; more barbarous life, the man.</p>
<p class="t0">Life is the triumph of our mouldering clay;</p>
<p class="t0">Death, of the spirit infinite! divine!</p>
<p class="t0">Death has no dread, but what frail life imparts;</p>
<p class="t0">Nor life true joy, but what kind death improves.<span class="lnum"> 470</span></p>
<p class="t0">No bliss has life to boast, till death can give</p>
<p class="t0">Far greater; life&rsquo;s a debtor to the grave,</p>
<p class="t0">Dark lattice! letting in eternal day.</p>
<p class="t">Lorenzo! blush at fondness for a life,</p>
<p class="t0">Which sends celestial souls on errands vile,</p>
<p class="t0">To cater for the sense; and serve at boards,</p>
<p class="t0">Where every ranger of the wilds, perhaps</p>
<p class="t0">Each reptile, justly claims our upper hand.</p>
<p class="t0">Luxurious feast! a soul, a soul immortal,</p>
<p class="t0">In all the dainties of a brute bemired!<span class="lnum"> 480</span></p>
<p class="t0">Lorenzo! blush at terror for a death,</p>
<p class="t0">Which gives thee to repose in festive bowers,</p>
<p class="t0">Where nectars sparkle, angels minister,</p>
<p class="t0">And more than angels share, and raise, and crown,</p>
<p class="t0">And eternize, the birth, bloom, bursts of bliss.</p>
<p class="t0">What need I more? O Death, the palm is thine.</p>
<p class="t">Then welcome, Death! thy dreaded harbingers,</p>
<p class="t0">Age and disease; disease, though long my guest;</p>
<p class="t0">That plucks my nerves, those tender strings of life;</p>
<p class="t0">Which, pluck&rsquo;d a little more, will toll the bell,<span class="lnum"> 490</span></p>
<p class="t0">That calls my few friends to my funeral;<span class="lnum"> 491</span></p>
<p class="t0">Where feeble nature drops, perhaps, a tear,</p>
<p class="t0">While reason and religion, better taught,</p>
<p class="t0">Congratulate the dead, and crown his tomb</p>
<p class="t0">With wreath triumphant. Death is victory;</p>
<p class="t0">It binds in chains the raging ills of life:</p>
<p class="t0">Lust and ambition, wrath and avarice,</p>
<p class="t0">Dragg&rsquo;d at his chariot-wheel, applaud his power.</p>
<p class="t0">That ills corrosive, cares importunate,</p>
<p class="t0">Are not immortal too, O Death! is thine.<span class="lnum"> 500</span></p>
<p class="t0">Our day of dissolution!&mdash;name it right;</p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Tis our great pay-day; &rsquo;tis our harvest, rich</p>
<p class="t0">And ripe: what though the sickle, sometimes keen,</p>
<p class="t0">Just scars us as we reap the golden grain?</p>
<p class="t0">More than thy balm, O Gilead! heals the wound.</p>
<p class="t0">Birth&rsquo;s feeble cry, and death&rsquo;s deep dismal groan,</p>
<p class="t0">Are slender tributes low-tax&rsquo;d nature pays</p>
<p class="t0">For mighty gain: the gain of each, a life!</p>
<p class="t0">But O! the last the former so transcends,</p>
<p class="t0">Life dies, compared; life lives beyond the grave.<span class="lnum"> 510</span></p>
<p class="t">And feel I, Death! no joy from thought of thee?</p>
<p class="t0">Death, the great counsellor, who man inspires</p>
<p class="t0">With every nobler thought, and fairer deed!</p>
<p class="t0">Death, the deliverer, who rescues man!</p>
<p class="t0">Death, the rewarder, who the rescued crowns!</p>
<p class="t0">Death, that absolves my birth; a curse without it!</p>
<p class="t0">Rich death, that realises all my cares,</p>
<p class="t0">Toils, virtues, hopes; without it a chimera!</p>
<p class="t0">Death, of all pain the period, not of joy;</p>
<p class="t0">Joy&rsquo;s source, and subject, still subsist unhurt;<span class="lnum"> 520</span></p>
<p class="t0">One, in my soul; and one, in her great Sire;</p>
<p class="t0">Though the four winds were warring for my dust.</p>
<p class="t0">Yes, and from winds, and waves, and central night,</p>
<p class="t0">Though prison&rsquo;d there, my dust too I reclaim</p>
<p class="t0">(To dust when drop proud nature&rsquo;s proudest spheres),</p>
<p class="t0">And live entire. Death is the crown of life:<span class="lnum"> 526</span></p>
<p class="t0">Were death denied, poor man would live in vain;</p>
<p class="t0">Were death denied, to live would not be life;</p>
<p class="t0">Were death denied, even fools would wish to die.</p>
<p class="t0">Death wounds to cure: we fall; we rise; we reign!</p>
<p class="t0">Spring from our fetters; fasten in the skies;</p>
<p class="t0">Where blooming Eden withers in our sight:</p>
<p class="t0">Death gives us more than was in Eden lost.</p>
<p class="t0">This king of terrors is the prince of peace.</p>
<p class="t0">When shall I die to vanity, pain, death?</p>
<p class="t0">When shall I die?&mdash;When shall I live for ever?<span class="lnum"> 536</span></p>

<h3>THE CHRISTIAN TRIUMPH.</h3>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">A much-indebted muse, O Yorke! intrudes.</p>
<p class="t0">Amid the smiles of fortune, and of youth,</p>
<p class="t0">Thine ear is patient of a serious song.</p>
<p class="t0">How deep implanted in the breast of man</p>
<p class="t0">The dread of death! I sing its sovereign cure.</p>
<p class="t">Why start at Death? Where is he? Death arrived,</p>
<p class="t0">Is past; not come, or gone, he&rsquo;s never here.</p>
<p class="t0">Ere hope, sensation fails; black-boding man</p>
<p class="t0">Receives, not suffers, Death&rsquo;s tremendous blow.</p>
<p class="t0">The knell, the shroud, the mattock, and the grave;<span class="lnum"> 10</span></p>
<p class="t0">The deep damp vault, the darkness, and the worm;</p>
<p class="t0">These are the bugbears of a winter&rsquo;s eve,</p>
<p class="t0">The terrors of the living, not the dead.</p>
<p class="t0">Imagination&rsquo;s fool, and error&rsquo;s wretch,</p>
<p class="t0">Man makes a death, which nature never made;</p>
<p class="t0">Then on the point of his own fancy falls;</p>
<p class="t0">And feels a thousand deaths, in fearing one.</p>
<p class="t">But were death frightful, what has age to fear?</p>
<p class="t0">If prudent, age should meet the friendly foe,</p>
<p class="t0">And shelter in his hospitable gloom.<span class="lnum"> 20</span></p>
<p class="t0">I scarce can meet a monument, but holds</p>
<p class="t0">My younger; every date cries&mdash;&ldquo;Come away.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">And what recalls me? Look the world around,</p>
<p class="t0">And tell me what: the wisest cannot tell.</p>
<p class="t0">Should any born of woman give his thought</p>
<p class="t0">Full range, on just dislike&rsquo;s unbounded field;</p>
<p class="t0">Of things, the vanity; of men, the flaws;</p>
<p class="t0">Flaws in the best; the many, flaw all o&rsquo;er;</p>
<p class="t0">As leopards, spotted, or, as Ethiops, dark;</p>
<p class="t0">Vivacious ill; good dying immature;<span class="lnum"> 30</span></p>
<p class="t0">(How immature, Narcissa&rsquo;s marble tells!)</p>
<p class="t0">And at his death bequeathing endless pain;</p>
<p class="t0">His heart, though bold, would sicken at the sight,</p>
<p class="t0">And spend itself in sighs, for future scenes.</p>
<p class="t">But grant to life (and just it is to grant</p>
<p class="t0">To lucky life) some perquisites of joy;</p>
<p class="t0">A time there is, when, like a thrice-told tale,</p>
<p class="t0">Long-rifled life of sweet can yield no more,</p>
<p class="t0">But from our comment on the comedy,</p>
<p class="t0">Pleasing reflections on parts well sustain&rsquo;d,<span class="lnum"> 40</span></p>
<p class="t0">Or purposed emendations where we fail&rsquo;d,</p>
<p class="t0">Or hopes of plaudits from our candid Judge,</p>
<p class="t0">When, on their exit, souls are bid unrobe,</p>
<p class="t0">Toss fortune back her tinsel, and her plume,</p>
<p class="t0">And drop this mask of flesh behind the scene.</p>
<p class="t">With me, that time is come; my world is dead;</p>
<p class="t0">A new world rises, and new manners reign:</p>
<p class="t0">Foreign comedians, a spruce band! arrive,</p>
<p class="t0">To push me from the scene, or hiss me there.</p>
<p class="t0">What a pert race starts up! the strangers gaze,<span class="lnum"> 50</span></p>
<p class="t0">And I at them; my neighbour is unknown;</p>
<p class="t0">Nor that the worst: ah me! the dire effect</p>
<p class="t0">Of loitering here, of Death defrauded long;</p>
<p class="t0">Of old so gracious (and let that suffice),<span class="lnum"> 54</span></p>
<p class="t0">My very master knows me not.&mdash;</p>
<p class="t">Shall I dare say, peculiar is the fate?</p>
<p class="t0">I&rsquo;ve been so long remember&rsquo;d, I&rsquo;m forgot.</p>
<p class="t0">An object ever pressing dims the sight,</p>
<p class="t0">And hides behind its ardour to be seen.</p>
<p class="t0">When in his courtiers&rsquo; ears I pour my plaint,<span class="lnum"> 60</span></p>
<p class="t0">They drink it as the nectar of the great;</p>
<p class="t0">And squeeze my hand, and beg me come to-morrow.</p>
<p class="t0">Refusal! canst thou wear a smoother form?</p>
<p class="t">Indulge me, nor conceive I drop my theme:</p>
<p class="t0">Who cheapens life, abates the fear of death:</p>
<p class="t0">Twice told the period spent on stubborn Troy,</p>
<p class="t0">Court favour, yet untaken, I besiege;</p>
<p class="t0">Ambition&rsquo;s ill-judged effort to be rich.</p>
<p class="t0">Alas! ambition makes my little less;</p>
<p class="t0">Embittering the possess&rsquo;d: Why wish for more?<span class="lnum"> 70</span></p>
<p class="t0">Wishing, of all employments, is the worst;</p>
<p class="t0">Philosophy&rsquo;s reverse; and health&rsquo;s decay!</p>
<p class="t0">Were I as plump as stall&rsquo;d theology,</p>
<p class="t0">Wishing would waste me to this shade again.</p>
<p class="t0">Were I as wealthy as a South Sea dream,</p>
<p class="t0">Wishing is an expedient to be poor.</p>
<p class="t0">Wishing, that constant hectic of a fool;</p>
<p class="t0">Caught at a court; purged off by purer air,</p>
<p class="t0">And simpler diet; gifts of rural life!</p>
<p class="t">Bless&rsquo;d be that hand divine, which gently laid<span class="lnum"> 80</span></p>
<p class="t0">My heart at rest, beneath this humble shed.</p>
<p class="t0">The world&rsquo;s a stately bark, on dangerous seas,</p>
<p class="t0">With pleasure seen, but boarded at our peril;</p>
<p class="t0">Here, on a single plank, thrown safe ashore,</p>
<p class="t0">I hear the tumult of the distant throng,</p>
<p class="t0">As that of seas remote, or dying storms:</p>
<p class="t0">And meditate on scenes, more silent still;</p>
<p class="t0">Pursue my theme, and fight the fear of death.<span class="lnum"> 88</span></p>
<p class="t0">Here, like a shepherd gazing from his hut,</p>
<p class="t0">Touching his reed, or leaning on his staff,</p>
<p class="t0">Eager ambition&rsquo;s fiery chace I see;</p>
<p class="t0">I see the circling hunt, of noisy men,</p>
<p class="t0">Burst law&rsquo;s enclosure, leap the mounds of right,</p>
<p class="t0">Pursuing, and pursued, each other&rsquo;s prey;</p>
<p class="t0">As wolves, for rapine; as the fox, for wiles;</p>
<p class="t0">Till Death, that mighty hunter, earths them all.</p>
<p class="t">Why all this toil for triumphs of an hour?</p>
<p class="t0">What though we wade in wealth, or soar in fame?</p>
<p class="t0">Earth&rsquo;s highest station ends in &ldquo;Here he lies:&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">And &ldquo;Dust to dust&rdquo; concludes her noblest song.<span class="lnum"> 100</span></p>
<p class="t0">If this song lives, posterity shall know</p>
<p class="t0">One, though in Britain born, with courtiers bred,</p>
<p class="t0">Who thought even gold might come a day too late;</p>
<p class="t0">Nor on his subtle death-bed plann&rsquo;d his scheme</p>
<p class="t0">For future vacancies in Church or State;</p>
<p class="t0">Some avocation deeming it&mdash;to die,</p>
<p class="t0">Unbit by rage canine of dying rich;</p>
<p class="t0">Guilt&rsquo;s blunder! and the loudest laugh of hell.</p>
<p class="t">O my coevals! remnants of yourselves!</p>
<p class="t0">Poor human ruins, tottering o&rsquo;er the grave!<span class="lnum"> 110</span></p>
<p class="t0">Shall we, shall aged men, like aged trees,</p>
<p class="t0">Strike deeper their vile root, and closer cling,</p>
<p class="t0">Still more enamour&rsquo;d of this wretched soil?</p>
<p class="t0">Shall our pale, wither&rsquo;d hands, be still stretch&rsquo;d out,</p>
<p class="t0">Trembling, at once, with eagerness and age?</p>
<p class="t0">With avarice, and convulsions, grasping hard?</p>
<p class="t0">Grasping at air! for what has earth beside?</p>
<p class="t0">Man wants but little; nor that little, long;</p>
<p class="t0">How soon must he resign his very dust,</p>
<p class="t0">Which frugal nature lent him for an hour!<span class="lnum"> 120</span></p>
<p class="t0">Years unexperienced rush on numerous ills;</p>
<p class="t0">And soon as man, expert from time, has found<span class="lnum"> 122</span></p>
<p class="t0">The key of life, it opes the gates of death.</p>
<p class="t">When in this vale of years I backward look,</p>
<p class="t0">And miss such numbers, numbers too of such,</p>
<p class="t0">Firmer in health, and greener in their age,</p>
<p class="t0">And stricter on their guard, and fitter far</p>
<p class="t0">To play life&rsquo;s subtle game, I scarce believe</p>
<p class="t0">I still survive: and am I fond of life,</p>
<p class="t0">Who scarce can think it possible, I live?<span class="lnum"> 130</span></p>
<p class="t0">Alive by miracle! or, what is next,</p>
<p class="t0">Alive by Mead! if I am still alive,</p>
<p class="t0">Who long have buried what gives life to live,</p>
<p class="t0">Firmness of nerve, and energy of thought.</p>
<p class="t0">Life&rsquo;s lee is not more shallow, than impure,</p>
<p class="t0">And vapid; sense and reason show the door,</p>
<p class="t0">Call for my bier, and point me to the dust.</p>
<p class="t">O thou great arbiter of life and death!</p>
<p class="t0">Nature&rsquo;s immortal, immaterial Sun!</p>
<p class="t0">Whose all-prolific beam late call&rsquo;d me forth<span class="lnum"> 140</span></p>
<p class="t0">From darkness, teeming darkness, where I lay</p>
<p class="t0">The worm&rsquo;s inferior, and, in rank, beneath</p>
<p class="t0">The dust I tread on, high to bear my brow,</p>
<p class="t0">To drink the spirit of the golden day,</p>
<p class="t0">And triumph in existence; and could know</p>
<p class="t0">No motive, but my bliss; and hast ordain&rsquo;d</p>
<p class="t0">A rise in blessing! with the patriarch&rsquo;s joy,</p>
<p class="t0">Thy call I follow to the land unknown;</p>
<p class="t0">I trust in thee, and know in whom I trust;</p>
<p class="t0">Or life, or death, is equal; neither weighs:<span class="lnum"> 150</span></p>
<p class="t0">All weight in this&mdash;O let me live to thee!</p>
<p class="t">Though nature&rsquo;s terrors thus may be repress&rsquo;d;</p>
<p class="t0">Still frowns grim Death; guilt points the tyrant&rsquo;s spear.</p>
<p class="t0">And whence all human guilt? From death forgot.</p>
<p class="t0">Ah me! too long I set at nought the swarm</p>
<p class="t0">Of friendly warnings, which around me flew;<span class="lnum"> 156</span></p>
<p class="t0">And smiled, unsmitten: small my cause to smile!</p>
<p class="t0">Death&rsquo;s admonitions, like shafts upwards shot,</p>
<p class="t0">More dreadful by delay, the longer ere</p>
<p class="t0">They strike our hearts, the deeper is their wound;</p>
<p class="t0">O think how deep, Lorenzo! here it stings:</p>
<p class="t0">Who can appease its anguish? How it burns!<span class="lnum"> 162</span></p>
<p class="t0">What hand the barb&rsquo;d, envenom&rsquo;d thought can draw?</p>
<p class="t0">What healing hand can pour the balm of peace?</p>
<p class="t0">And turn my sight undaunted on the tomb?</p>
<p class="t">With joy,&mdash;with grief, that healing hand I see;</p>
<p class="t0">Ah! too conspicuous! it is fix&rsquo;d on high.</p>
<p class="t0">On high?&mdash;What means my phrensy? I blaspheme;</p>
<p class="t0">Alas! how low! how far beneath the skies!</p>
<p class="t0">The skies it form&rsquo;d; and now it bleeds for me&mdash;<span class="lnum"> 170</span></p>
<p class="t0">But bleeds the balm I want&mdash;yet still it bleeds;</p>
<p class="t0">Draw the dire steel&mdash;ah, no! the dreadful blessing</p>
<p class="t0">What heart or can sustain, or dares forego?</p>
<p class="t0">There hangs all human hope: that nail supports</p>
<p class="t0">The falling universe: that gone, we drop;</p>
<p class="t0">Horror receives us, and the dismal wish</p>
<p class="t0">Creation had been smother&rsquo;d in her birth&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">Darkness his curtain, and his bed the dust;</p>
<p class="t0">When stars and sun are dust beneath his throne!</p>
<p class="t0">In heaven itself can such indulgence dwell?<span class="lnum"> 180</span></p>
<p class="t0">Oh, what a groan was there! a groan not his.</p>
<p class="t0">He seized our dreadful right; the load sustained;</p>
<p class="t0">And heaved the mountain from a guilty world.</p>
<p class="t0">A thousand worlds, so bought, were bought too dear;</p>
<p class="t0">Sensations new in angels&rsquo; bosoms rise;</p>
<p class="t0">Suspend their song; and make a pause in bliss.</p>
<p class="t">O for their song, to reach my lofty theme!</p>
<p class="t0">Inspire me, Night! with all thy tuneful spheres;</p>
<p class="t0">Whilst I with seraphs share seraphic themes,</p>

<p class="t0">Lest I blaspheme my subject with my song.</p>

<p class="t0">Of heathen error, with a golden flood</p>
<p class="t0">Of endless day: to feel, is to be fired;</p>
<p class="t0">And to believe, Lorenzo! is to feel.<span class="lnum"> 200</span></p>
<p class="t">Thou most indulgent, most tremendous Power!</p>
<p class="t0">Still more tremendous, for thy wondrous love!</p>
<p class="t0">That arms, with awe more awful, thy commands;</p>
<p class="t0">And foul transgression dips in sevenfold night;</p>
<p class="t0">How our hearts tremble at thy love immense!</p>
<p class="t0">In love immense, inviolably just!</p>
<p class="t0">Thou, rather than thy justice should be stain&rsquo;d,</p>

<p class="t">Bold thought! shall I dare speak it, or repress?<span class="lnum"> 210</span></p>

<p class="t0">Faith builds a bridge across the gulf of death,</p>

<p class="t0">Reason the root, fair faith is but the flower;</p>
<p class="t0">The fading flower shall die; but reason lives</p>

<p class="t0">When faith is virtue, reason makes it so.</p>
<p class="t0">Wrong not the Christian; think not reason yours:</p>

<p class="t0">&rsquo;Tis reason&rsquo;s injured rights his wrath resents;</p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Tis reason&rsquo;s voice obey&rsquo;d his glories crown;</p>

<p class="t0">By day the soul is passive, all her thoughts</p>
<p class="t0">Imposed, precarious, broken ere mature.</p>
<p class="t0">By night, from objects free, from passion cool,<span class="lnum"> 120</span></p>
<p class="t0">Thoughts uncontroll&rsquo;d, and unimpress&rsquo;d, the births</p>

<p class="t">Virtue, for ever frail, as fair, below,</p>

<p class="t0">Riot, pride, perfidy, blue vapours breathe;<span class="lnum"> 157</span></p>
<p class="t0">And inhumanity is caught from man,</p>

<p class="t0">Must list as their accomplices, or foes;</p>
<p class="t0">That stains our innocence; this wounds our peace.</p>

<p class="t0">The wondrous cause, of this mysterious ill?<span class="lnum"> 391</span></p>
<p class="t0">All heaven looks down astonish&rsquo;d at the sight.</p>
<p class="t">Is it, that life has sown her joys so thick,</p>
<p class="t0">We can&rsquo;t thrust in a single care between?</p>
<p class="t0">Is it, that life has such a swarm of cares,</p>
<p class="t0">The thought of death can&rsquo;t enter for the throng?</p>
<p class="t0">Is it, that time steals on with downy feet,</p>
<p class="t0">Nor wakes indulgence from her golden dream?</p>
<p class="t0">To-day is so like yesterday, it cheats;</p>
<p class="t0">We take the lying sister for the same.<span class="lnum"> 400</span></p>
<p class="t0">Life glides away, Lorenzo, like a brook;</p>
<p class="t0">For ever changing, unperceived the change.</p>
<p class="t0">In the same brook none ever bathed him twice:</p>
<p class="t0">To the same life none ever twice awoke.</p>
<p class="t0">We call the brook the same; the same we think</p>
<p class="t0">Our life, though still more rapid in its flow;</p>
<p class="t0">Nor mark the much, irrevocably lapsed,</p>
<p class="t0">And mingled with the sea. Or shall we say</p>
<p class="t0">(Retaining still the brook to bear us on)</p>
<p class="t0">That life is like a vessel on the stream?<span class="lnum"> 410</span></p>
<p class="t0">In life embark&rsquo;d, we smoothly down the tide</p>
<p class="t0">Of time descend, but not on time intent;</p>
<p class="t0">Amused, unconscious of the gliding wave;</p>
<p class="t0">Till on a sudden we perceive a shock;</p>
<p class="t0">We start, awake, look out; what see we there?</p>
<p class="t0">Our brittle bark is burst on Charon&rsquo;s shore.</p>
<p class="t">Is this the cause death flies all human thought?</p>
<p class="t0">Or is it judgment, by the will struck blind,</p>
<p class="t0">That domineering mistress of the soul!</p>
<p class="t0">Like him so strong, by Dalilah the fair?<span class="lnum"> 420</span></p>
<p class="t0">Or is it fear turns startled reason back,</p>
<p class="t0">From looking down a precipice so steep?</p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Tis dreadful; and the dread is wisely placed,</p>
<p class="t0">By nature, conscious of the make of man.</p>
<p class="t0">A dreadful friend it is, a terror kind,<span class="lnum"> 425</span></p>
<p class="t0">A flaming sword to guard the tree of life.</p>
<p class="t0">By that unawed, in life&rsquo;s most smiling hour,</p>
<p class="t0">The good man would repine; would suffer joys,</p>
<p class="t0">And burn impatient for his promised skies.</p>
<p class="t0">The bad, on each punctilious pique of pride,</p>
<p class="t0">Or gloom of humour, would give rage the rein;</p>
<p class="t0">Bound o&rsquo;er the barrier, rush into the dark,<span class="lnum"> 432</span></p>
<p class="t0">And mar the schemes of Providence below.</p>
<p class="t">What groan was that, Lorenzo?&mdash;Furies! rise,</p>
<p class="t0">And drown in your less execrable yell</p>
<p class="t0">Britannia&rsquo;s shame. There took her gloomy flight,</p>
<p class="t0">On wing impetuous, a black sullen soul,</p>
<p class="t0">Blasted from hell, with horrid lust of death;</p>
<p class="t0">Thy friend, the brave, the gallant Altamont,</p>
<p class="t0">So call&rsquo;d, so thought&mdash;and then he fled the field.<span class="lnum"> 440</span></p>
<p class="t0">Less base the fear of death, than fear of life.</p>
<p class="t0">O Britain, infamous for suicide!</p>
<p class="t0">An island in thy manners! far disjoin&rsquo;d</p>
<p class="t0">From the whole world of rationals beside!</p>
<p class="t0">In ambient waves plunge thy polluted head,</p>
<p class="t0">Wash the dire stain, nor shock the Continent.</p>
<p class="t">But thou be shock&rsquo;d, while I detect the cause</p>
<p class="t0">Of self-assault, expose the monster&rsquo;s birth,</p>
<p class="t0">And bid abhorrence hiss it round the world.</p>
<p class="t0">Blame not thy clime, nor chide the distant sun;<span class="lnum"> 450</span></p>
<p class="t0">The sun is innocent, thy clime absolved:</p>
<p class="t0">Immoral climes kind nature never made.</p>
<p class="t0">The cause I sing, in Eden might prevail,</p>
<p class="t0">And proves, it is thy folly, not thy fate.</p>
<p class="t">The soul of man (let man in homage bow,</p>
<p class="t0">Who names his soul), a native of the skies!</p>
<p class="t0">High-born, and free, her freedom should maintain,</p>
<p class="t0">Unsold, unmortgaged for earth&rsquo;s little bribes.</p>
<p class="t0">Th&rsquo; illustrious stranger, in this foreign land,<span class="lnum"> 459</span></p>
<p class="t0">Like strangers, jealous of her dignity,</p>
<p class="t0">Studious of home, and ardent to return,</p>
<p class="t0">Of earth suspicious, earth&rsquo;s enchanted cup</p>
<p class="t0">With cool reserve light touching, should indulge</p>
<p class="t0">On immortality her godlike taste;</p>
<p class="t0">There take large draughts, make her chief banquet there.</p>
<p class="t">But some reject this sustenance divine;</p>
<p class="t0">To beggarly vile appetites descend;</p>
<p class="t0">Ask alms of earth, for guests that came from heaven!</p>
<p class="t0">Sink into slaves; and sell, for present hire,</p>
<p class="t0">Their rich reversion, and (what shares its fate)<span class="lnum"> 470</span></p>
<p class="t0">Their native freedom, to the prince who sways</p>
<p class="t0">This nether world. And when his payments fail,</p>
<p class="t0">When his foul basket gorges them no more,</p>
<p class="t0">Or their pall&rsquo;d palates loathe the basket full;</p>
<p class="t0">Are instantly, with wild demoniac rage,</p>
<p class="t0">For breaking all the chains of Providence,</p>
<p class="t0">And bursting their confinement; though fast barr&rsquo;d</p>
<p class="t0">By laws divine and human; guarded strong</p>
<p class="t0">With horrors doubled to defend the pass,</p>
<p class="t0">The blackest, nature, or dire guilt, can raise;<span class="lnum"> 480</span></p>
<p class="t0">And moated round with fathomless destruction,</p>
<p class="t0">Sure to receive, and whelm them in their fall.</p>
<p class="t">Such, Britons! is the cause, to you unknown,</p>
<p class="t0">Or worse, o&rsquo;erlook&rsquo;d; o&rsquo;erlook&rsquo;d by magistrates,</p>
<p class="t0">Thus criminals themselves. I grant the deed</p>
<p class="t0">Is madness, but the madness of the heart.</p>
<p class="t0">And what is that? Our utmost bound of guilt.</p>
<p class="t0">A sensual, unreflecting life, is big</p>
<p class="t0">With monstrous births, and suicide, to crown</p>
<p class="t0">The black infernal brood. The bold to break<span class="lnum"> 490</span></p>
<p class="t0">Heaven&rsquo;s law supreme, and desperately rush,</p>
<p class="t0">Through sacred Nature&rsquo;s murder, on their own,</p>
<p class="t0">Because they never think of death, they die.<span class="lnum"> 493</span></p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Tis equally man&rsquo;s duty, glory, gain,</p>
<p class="t0">At once to shun, and meditate, his end.</p>
<p class="t0">When by the bed of languishment we sit</p>
<p class="t0">(The seat of wisdom! if our choice, not fate),</p>
<p class="t0">Or, o&rsquo;er our dying friends, in anguish hang,</p>
<p class="t0">Wipe the cold dew, or stay the sinking head,</p>
<p class="t0">Number their moments, and, in every clock,<span class="lnum"> 500</span></p>
<p class="t0">Start at the voice of an eternity;</p>
<p class="t0">See the dim lamp of life just feebly lift</p>
<p class="t0">An agonizing beam, at us to gaze,</p>
<p class="t0">Then sink again, and quiver into death,</p>
<p class="t0">That most pathetic herald of our own;</p>
<p class="t0">How read we such sad scenes? As sent to man</p>
<p class="t0">In perfect vengeance? No; in pity sent,</p>
<p class="t0">To melt him down, like wax, and then impress,</p>
<p class="t0">Indelible, Death&rsquo;s image on his heart;</p>
<p class="t0">Bleeding for others, trembling for himself.<span class="lnum"> 510</span></p>
<p class="t0">We bleed, we tremble, we forget, we smile.</p>
<p class="t0">The mind turns fool, before the cheek is dry.</p>
<p class="t0">Our quick-returning folly cancels all;</p>
<p class="t0">As the tide rushing razes what is writ</p>
<p class="t0">In yielding sands, and smooths the letter&rsquo;d shore.</p>
<p class="t">Lorenzo! hast thou ever weigh&rsquo;d a sigh?</p>
<p class="t0">Or studied the philosophy of tears?</p>
<p class="t0">(A science, yet unlectured in our schools!)</p>
<p class="t0">Hast thou descended deep into the breast,</p>
<p class="t0">And seen their source? If not, descend with me,<span class="lnum"> 520</span></p>
<p class="t0">And trace these briny rivulets to their springs.</p>
<p class="t">Our funeral tears from different causes rise,</p>
<p class="t0">As if from separate cisterns in the soul,</p>
<p class="t0">Of various kinds, they flow. From tender hearts,</p>
<p class="t0">By soft contagion call&rsquo;d, some burst at once,</p>
<p class="t0">And stream obsequious to the leading eye.</p>
<p class="t0">Some ask more time, by curious art distill&rsquo;d.<span class="lnum"> 527</span></p>
<p class="t0">Some hearts, in secret hard, unapt to melt,</p>
<p class="t0">Struck by the magic of the public eye,</p>
<p class="t0">Like Moses&rsquo; smitten rock, gush out amain.</p>
<p class="t0">Some weep to share the fame of the deceased,</p>
<p class="t0">So high in merit, and to them so dear.</p>
<p class="t0">They dwell on praises, which they think they share;<span class="lnum"> 533</span></p>
<p class="t0">And thus, without a blush, commend themselves.</p>
<p class="t0">Some mourn, in proof that something they could love:</p>
<p class="t0">They weep not to relieve their grief, but show.</p>
<p class="t0">Some weep in perfect justice to the dead,</p>
<p class="t0">As conscious all their love is in arrear.</p>
<p class="t0">Some mischievously weep, not unapprised</p>
<p class="t0">Tears, sometimes, aid the conquest of an eye.<span class="lnum"> 540</span></p>
<p class="t0">With what address the soft Ephesians draw</p>
<p class="t0">Their sable network o&rsquo;er entangled hearts!</p>
<p class="t0">As seen through crystal, how their roses glow,</p>
<p class="t0">While liquid pearl runs trickling down their cheek!</p>
<p class="t0">Of hers not prouder Egypt&rsquo;s wanton queen,</p>
<p class="t0">Carousing gems, herself dissolved in love.</p>
<p class="t0">Some weep at death, abstracted from the dead,</p>
<p class="t0">And celebrate, like Charles,<sup><a id="fr_22" href="#fn_22">[22]</a></sup> their own decease.</p>
<p class="t0">By kind construction some are deem&rsquo;d to weep,</p>
<p class="t0">Because a decent veil conceals their joy.<span class="lnum"> 550</span></p>
<p class="t">Some weep in earnest, and yet weep in vain;</p>
<p class="t0">As deep in indiscretion, as in woe.</p>
<p class="t0">Passion, blind Passion! impotently pours</p>
<p class="t0">Tears, that deserve more tears; while Reason sleeps;</p>
<p class="t0">Or gazes like an idiot, unconcern&rsquo;d;</p>
<p class="t0">Nor comprehends the meaning of the storm;</p>
<p class="t0">Knows not it speaks to her, and her alone.</p>
<p class="t0">Irrationals all sorrow are beneath,</p>
<p class="t0">That noble gift! that privilege of man!</p>
<p class="t0">From sorrow&rsquo;s pang, the birth of endless joy.<span class="lnum"> 560</span></p>
<p class="t0">But these are barren of that birth divine:</p>
<p class="t0">They weep impetuous, as the summer storm,</p>
<p class="t0">And full as short! The cruel grief soon tamed,</p>
<p class="t0">They make a pastime of the stingless tale;</p>
<p class="t0">Far as the deep resounding knell, they spread</p>
<p class="t0">The dreadful news, and hardly feel it more.</p>
<p class="t0">No grain of wisdom pays them for their woe.</p>
<p class="t">Half-round the globe, the tears pump&rsquo;d up by Death</p>
<p class="t0">Are spent in watering vanities of life;</p>
<p class="t0">In making folly flourish still more fair,<span class="lnum"> 570</span></p>
<p class="t0">When the sick soul, her wonted stay withdrawn,</p>
<p class="t0">Reclines on earth, and sorrows in the dust;</p>
<p class="t0">Instead of learning, there, her true support,</p>
<p class="t0">Though there thrown down her true support to learn.</p>
<p class="t0">Without Heaven&rsquo;s aid, impatient to be bless&rsquo;d,</p>
<p class="t0">She crawls to the next shrub, or bramble vile,</p>
<p class="t0">Though from the stately cedar&rsquo;s arms she fell;</p>
<p class="t0">With stale, forsworn embraces, clings anew,</p>
<p class="t0">The stranger weds, and blossoms, as before,</p>
<p class="t0">In all the fruitless fopperies of life:<span class="lnum"> 580</span></p>
<p class="t0">Presents her weed, well-fancied, at the ball,</p>
<p class="t0">And raffles for the Death&rsquo;s-head on the ring.</p>
<p class="t">So wept Aurelia, till the destined youth</p>
<p class="t0">Stepp&rsquo;d in, with his receipt for making smiles,</p>
<p class="t0">And blanching sables into bridal bloom.</p>
<p class="t0">So wept Lorenzo fair Clarissa&rsquo;s fate;</p>
<p class="t0">Who gave that angel boy, on whom he doats;</p>
<p class="t0">And died to give him, orphan&rsquo;d in his birth!</p>
<p class="t0">Not such, Narcissa, my distress for thee.</p>
<p class="t0">I&rsquo;ll make an altar of thy sacred tomb,<span class="lnum"> 590</span></p>
<p class="t0">To sacrifice to wisdom.&mdash;What wast thou?</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Young, gay, and fortunate!&rdquo; Each yields a theme.</p>
<p class="t0">I&rsquo;ll dwell on each, to shun thought more severe;</p>
<p class="t0">(Heaven knows I labour with severer still!)<span class="lnum"> 594</span></p>
<p class="t0">I&rsquo;ll dwell on each, and quite exhaust thy death.</p>
<p class="t0">A soul without reflection, like a pile</p>
<p class="t0">Without inhabitant, to ruin runs.</p>
<p class="t">And, first, thy youth. What says it to grey hairs?</p>
<p class="t0">Narcissa, I&rsquo;m become thy pupil now&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">Early, bright, transient, chaste, as morning dew,</p>
<p class="t0">She sparkled, was exhaled, and went to heaven.</p>
<p class="t0">Time on this head has snow&rsquo;d; yet still &rsquo;tis borne<span class="lnum"> 602</span></p>
<p class="t0">Aloft; nor thinks but on another&rsquo;s grave.</p>
<p class="t0">Cover&rsquo;d with shame I speak it, age severe</p>
<p class="t0">Old worn-out vice sets down for virtue fair;</p>
<p class="t0">With graceless gravity, chastising youth,</p>
<p class="t0">That youth chastised surpassing in a fault,</p>
<p class="t0">Father of all, forgetfulness of death:</p>
<p class="t0">As if, like objects pressing on the sight,</p>
<p class="t0">Death had advanced too near us to be seen:<span class="lnum"> 610</span></p>
<p class="t0">Or, that life&rsquo;s loan Time ripen&rsquo;d into right;</p>
<p class="t0">And men might plead prescription from the grave;</p>
<p class="t0">Deathless, from repetition of reprieve.</p>
<p class="t0">Deathless? far from it! such are dead already;</p>
<p class="t0">Their hearts are buried, and the world their grave.</p>
<p class="t">Tell me, some god! my guardian angel! tell,</p>
<p class="t0">What thus infatuates? what enchantment plants</p>
<p class="t0">The phantom of an age &rsquo;twixt us, and Death</p>
<p class="t0">Already at the door? He knocks, we hear,</p>
<p class="t0">And yet we will not hear. What mail defends<span class="lnum"> 620</span></p>
<p class="t0">Our untouch&rsquo;d hearts? what miracle turns off</p>
<p class="t0">The pointed thought, which from a thousand quivers</p>
<p class="t0">Is daily darted, and is daily shunn&rsquo;d?</p>
<p class="t0">We stand, as in a battle, throngs on throngs</p>
<p class="t0">Around us falling; wounded oft ourselves;</p>
<p class="t0">Though bleeding with our wounds, immortal still!</p>
<p class="t0">We see Time&rsquo;s furrows on another&rsquo;s brow,</p>
<p class="t0">And Death intrench&rsquo;d, preparing his assault;<span class="lnum"> 628</span></p>
<p class="t0">How few themselves, in that just mirror, see,</p>
<p class="t0">Or, seeing, draw their inference as strong!</p>
<p class="t0">There, death is certain; doubtful here: he must,</p>
<p class="t0">And soon; we may, within an age, expire.</p>
<p class="t0">Though grey our heads, our thoughts and aims are green;</p>
<p class="t0">Like damaged clocks, whose hand and bell dissent;</p>
<p class="t0">Folly sings six, while Nature points at twelve.</p>
<p class="t">Absurd longevity! More, more! it cries:</p>
<p class="t0">More life, more wealth, more trash of every kind.</p>
<p class="t0">And wherefore mad for more, when relish fails?</p>
<p class="t0">Object, and appetite, must club for joy;</p>
<p class="t0">Shall Folly labour hard to mend the bow,<span class="lnum"> 640</span></p>
<p class="t0">Baubles, I mean, that strike us from without,</p>
<p class="t0">While Nature is relaxing every string?</p>
<p class="t0">Ask thought for joy; grow rich, and hoard within.</p>
<p class="t0">Think you the soul, when this life&rsquo;s rattles cease,</p>
<p class="t0">Has nothing of more manly to succeed?</p>
<p class="t0">Contract the taste immortal; learn even now</p>
<p class="t0">To relish what alone subsists hereafter.</p>
<p class="t0">Divine, or none, henceforth your joys for ever.</p>
<p class="t0">Of age the glory is, to wish to die.</p>
<p class="t0">That wish is praise, and promise; it applauds<span class="lnum"> 650</span></p>
<p class="t0">Past life, and promises our future bliss.</p>
<p class="t0">What weakness see not children in their sires?</p>
<p class="t0">Grand-climacterical absurdities!</p>
<p class="t0">Grey-hair&rsquo;d authority, to faults of youth,</p>
<p class="t0">How shocking! it makes folly thrice a fool;</p>
<p class="t0">And our first childhood might our last despise.</p>
<p class="t0">Peace and esteem is all that age can hope.</p>
<p class="t0">Nothing but wisdom gives the first; the last,</p>
<p class="t0">Nothing, but the repute of being wise.</p>
<p class="t0">Folly bars both; our age is quite undone.<span class="lnum"> 660</span></p>
<p class="t">What folly can be ranker? Like our shadows,</p>
<p class="t0">Our wishes lengthen, as our sun declines.<span class="lnum"> 662</span></p>
<p class="t0">No wish should loiter, then, this side the grave.</p>
<p class="t0">Our hearts should leave the world, before the knell</p>
<p class="t0">Calls for our carcases to mend the soil.</p>
<p class="t0">Enough to live in tempest, die in port;</p>
<p class="t0">Age should fly concourse, cover in retreat</p>
<p class="t0">Defects of judgment; and the will subdue;</p>
<p class="t0">Walk thoughtful on the silent, solemn shore</p>
<p class="t0">Of that vast ocean it must sail so soon;<span class="lnum"> 670</span></p>
<p class="t0">And put good works on board; and wait the wind</p>
<p class="t0">That shortly blows us into worlds unknown:</p>
<p class="t0">If unconsider&rsquo;d too, a dreadful scene!</p>
<p class="t">All should be prophets to themselves; foresee</p>
<p class="t0">Their future fate; their future fate foretaste;</p>
<p class="t0">This art would waste the bitterness of death.</p>
<p class="t0">The thought of death alone, the fear destroys.</p>
<p class="t0">A disaffection to that precious thought</p>
<p class="t0">Is more than midnight darkness on the soul,</p>
<p class="t0">Which sleeps beneath it, on a precipice,<span class="lnum"> 680</span></p>
<p class="t0">Puff&rsquo;d off by the first blast, and lost for ever.</p>
<p class="t">Dost ask, Lorenzo, why so warmly press&rsquo;d,</p>
<p class="t0">By repetition hammer&rsquo;d on thine ear,</p>
<p class="t0">The thought of death? That thought is the machine,</p>
<p class="t0">The grand machine, that heaves us from the dust,</p>
<p class="t0">And rears us into men. That thought, plied home,</p>
<p class="t0">Will soon reduce the ghastly precipice</p>
<p class="t0">O&rsquo;er-hanging hell, will soften the descent,</p>
<p class="t0">And gently slope our passage to the grave;</p>
<p class="t0">How warmly to be wish&rsquo;d! What heart of flesh<span class="lnum"> 690</span></p>
<p class="t0">Would trifle with tremendous? dare extremes?</p>
<p class="t0">Yawn o&rsquo;er the fate of infinite? What hand,</p>
<p class="t0">Beyond the blackest brand of censure bold,</p>
<p class="t0">(To speak a language too well known to thee),</p>
<p class="t0">Would at a moment give its all to chance,<span class="lnum"> 695</span></p>
<p class="t0">And stamp the die for an eternity?</p>
<p class="t">Aid me, Narcissa! aid me to keep pace</p>
<p class="t0">With Destiny; and ere her scissors cut</p>
<p class="t0">My thread of life, to break this tougher thread</p>
<p class="t0">Of moral death, that ties me to the world.</p>
<p class="t0">Sting thou my slumbering reason to send forth</p>
<p class="t0">A thought of observation on the foe;<span class="lnum"> 702</span></p>
<p class="t0">To sally; and survey the rapid march</p>
<p class="t0">Of his ten thousand messengers to man;</p>
<p class="t0">Who, Jehu-like, behind him turns them all.</p>
<p class="t0">All accident apart, by Nature sign&rsquo;d,</p>
<p class="t0">My warrant is gone out, though dormant yet;</p>
<p class="t0">Perhaps behind one moment lurks my fate.</p>
<p class="t">Must I then forward only look for Death?</p>
<p class="t0">Backward I turn mine eye, and find him there.<span class="lnum"> 710</span></p>
<p class="t0">Man is a self-survivor every year.</p>
<p class="t0">Man, like a stream, is in perpetual flow.</p>
<p class="t0">Death&rsquo;s a destroyer of quotidian<sup><a id="fr_23" href="#fn_23">[23]</a></sup> prey.</p>
<p class="t0">My youth, my noontide, his; my yesterday;</p>
<p class="t0">The bold invader shares the present hour.</p>
<p class="t0">Each moment on the former shuts the grave.</p>
<p class="t0">While man is growing, life is in decrease;</p>
<p class="t0">And cradles rock us nearer to the tomb.</p>
<p class="t0">Our birth is nothing but our death begun;</p>
<p class="t0">As tapers waste, that instant they take fire.<span class="lnum"> 720</span></p>
<p class="t">Shall we then fear, lest that should come to pass,</p>
<p class="t0">Which comes to pass each moment of our lives?</p>
<p class="t0">If fear we must, let that Death turn us pale,</p>
<p class="t0">Which murders strength and ardour; what remains</p>
<p class="t0">Should rather call on Death, than dread his call.</p>
<p class="t0">Ye partners of my fault, and my decline!</p>
<p class="t0">Thoughtless of death, but when your neighbour&rsquo;s knell</p>
<p class="t0">(Rude visitant!) knocks hard at your dull sense,</p>
<p class="t0">And with its thunder scarce obtains your ear!<span class="lnum"> 729</span></p>
<p class="t0">Be death your theme, in every place and hour;</p>
<p class="t0">Nor longer want, ye monumental sires!</p>

<p class="t0">That death you dread (so great is Nature&rsquo;s skill)</p>
<p class="t0">Know, you shall court before you shall enjoy.</p>
<p class="t">But you are learn&rsquo;d; in volumes deep, you sit;</p>
<p class="t0">In wisdom, shallow: pompous ignorance!</p>
<p class="t0">Would you be still more learned than the learn&rsquo;d?</p>
<p class="t0">Learn well to know how much need not be known,</p>
<p class="t0">And what that knowledge, which impairs your sense.</p>
<p class="t0">Our needful knowledge, like our needful food,<span class="lnum"> 740</span></p>
<p class="t0">Unhedged, lies open in life&rsquo;s common field;</p>
<p class="t0">And bids all welcome to the vital feast.</p>
<p class="t0">You scorn what lies before you in the page</p>
<p class="t0">Of Nature, and Experience, moral truth;</p>
<p class="t0">Of indispensable, eternal fruit;</p>
<p class="t0">Fruit, on which mortals feeding, turn to gods:</p>
<p class="t0">And dive in science for distinguish&rsquo;d names,</p>
<p class="t0">Dishonest fomentation of your pride!</p>
<p class="t0">Sinking in virtue, as you rise in fame.</p>
<p class="t0">Your learning, like the lunar beam, affords<span class="lnum"> 750</span></p>
<p class="t0">Light, but not heat; it leaves you indevout,</p>
<p class="t0">Frozen at heart, while speculation shines.</p>
<p class="t0">Awake, ye curious indagators! fond</p>
<p class="t0">Of knowing all, but what avails you known.</p>
<p class="t0">If you would learn Death&rsquo;s character, attend.</p>
<p class="t0">All casts of conduct, all degrees of health,</p>
<p class="t0">All dies of fortune, and all dates of age,</p>
<p class="t0">Together shook in his impartial urn,</p>
<p class="t0">Come forth at random: or, if choice is made,</p>
<p class="t0">The choice is quite sarcastic, and insults<span class="lnum"> 760</span></p>
<p class="t0">All bold conjecture, and fond hopes of man.</p>
<p class="t0">What countless multitudes not only leave,</p>
<p class="t0">But deeply disappoint us, by their deaths!<span class="lnum"> 763</span></p>
<p class="t0">Though great our sorrow, greater our surprise.</p>
<p class="t">Like other tyrants, Death delights to smite,</p>
<p class="t0">What, smitten, most proclaims the pride of power,</p>
<p class="t0">And arbitrary nod. His joy supreme,</p>
<p class="t0">To bid the wretch survive the fortunate;</p>
<p class="t0">The feeble wrap th&rsquo; athletic in his shroud;</p>
<p class="t0">And weeping fathers build their children&rsquo;s tomb:<span class="lnum"> 770</span></p>
<p class="t0">Me thine, Narcissa!&mdash;What though short thy date?</p>
<p class="t0">Virtue, not rolling suns, the mind matures.</p>
<p class="t0">That life is long, which answers life&rsquo;s great end.</p>
<p class="t0">The time that bears no fruit, deserves no name;</p>
<p class="t0">The man of wisdom is the man of years.</p>
<p class="t0">In hoary youth Methusalems may die;</p>
<p class="t0">O how misdated on their flattering tombs!</p>
<p class="t">Narcissa&rsquo;s youth has lectured me thus far.</p>
<p class="t0">And can her gaiety give counsel too?</p>
<p class="t0">That, like the Jews&rsquo; famed oracle of gems,<sup><a id="fr_24" href="#fn_24">[24]</a></sup><span class="lnum"> 780</span></p>
<p class="t0">Sparkles instruction; such as throws new light,</p>
<p class="t0">And opens more the character of Death;</p>
<p class="t0">Ill known to thee, Lorenzo! This thy vaunt:</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Give Death his due, the wretched, and the old;</p>
<p class="t0">Even let him sweep his rubbish to the grave;</p>
<p class="t0">Let him not violate kind Nature&rsquo;s laws,</p>
<p class="t0">But own man born to live as well as die.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">Wretched and old thou givest him; young and gay</p>
<p class="t0">He takes; and plunder is a tyrant&rsquo;s joy.</p>
<p class="t0">What if I prove, &ldquo;The farthest from the fear,<span class="lnum"> 790</span></p>
<p class="t0">Are often nearest to the stroke of Fate?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t">All, more than common, menaces an end.</p>
<p class="t0">A blaze betokens brevity of life:</p>
<p class="t0">As if bright embers should emit a flame,</p>
<p class="t0">Glad spirits sparkled from Narcissa&rsquo;s eye,</p>
<p class="t0">And made youth younger, and taught life to live,<span class="lnum"> 796</span></p>
<p class="t0">As Nature&rsquo;s opposites wage endless war,</p>
<p class="t0">For this offence, as treason to the deep</p>
<p class="t0">Inviolable stupor of his reign,</p>
<p class="t0">Where Lust, and turbulent Ambition, sleep,</p>
<p class="t0">Death took swift vengeance. As he life detests,</p>
<p class="t0">More life is still more odious; and, reduced</p>
<p class="t0">By conquest, aggrandizes more his power.<span class="lnum"> 803</span></p>
<p class="t0">But wherefore aggrandized? By Heaven&rsquo;s decree,</p>
<p class="t0">To plant the soul on her eternal guard,</p>
<p class="t0">In awful expectation of our end.</p>
<p class="t0">Thus runs Death&rsquo;s dread commission: &ldquo;Strike, but so</p>
<p class="t0">As most alarms the living by the dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">Hence stratagem delights him, and surprise,</p>
<p class="t0">And cruel sport with man&rsquo;s securities.<span class="lnum"> 810</span></p>
<p class="t0">Not simple conquest, triumph is his aim;</p>
<p class="t0">And, where least fear&rsquo;d, there conquest triumphs most.</p>
<p class="t0">This proves my bold assertion not too bold.</p>
<p class="t">What are his arts to lay our fears asleep?</p>
<p class="t0">Tiberian arts his purposes wrap up</p>
<p class="t0">In deep dissimulation&rsquo;s darkest night.</p>
<p class="t0">Like princes unconfess&rsquo;d in foreign courts,</p>
<p class="t0">Who travel under cover, Death assumes</p>
<p class="t0">The name and look of life, and dwells among us.</p>
<p class="t0">He takes all shapes that serve his black designs:<span class="lnum"> 820</span></p>
<p class="t0">Though master of a wider empire far</p>
<p class="t0">Than that o&rsquo;er which the Roman eagle flew.</p>
<p class="t0">Like Nero, he&rsquo;s a fiddler, charioteer,</p>
<p class="t0">Or drives his phaeton, in female guise;</p>
<p class="t0">Quite unsuspected, till, the wheel beneath,</p>
<p class="t0">His disarray&rsquo;d oblation he devours.</p>
<p class="t">He most affects the forms least like himself,</p>
<p class="t0">His slender self. Hence burly corpulence</p>
<p class="t0">Is his familiar wear, and sleek disguise.</p>
<p class="t0">Behind the rosy bloom he loves to lurk,<span class="lnum"> 830</span></p>
<p class="t0">Or ambush in a smile; or wanton dive</p>
<p class="t0">In dimples deep; love&rsquo;s eddies, which draw in</p>
<p class="t0">Unwary hearts, and sink them in despair.</p>
<p class="t0">Such, on Narcissa&rsquo;s couch he loiter&rsquo;d long</p>
<p class="t0">Unknown; and, when detected, still was seen</p>
<p class="t0">To smile; such peace has innocence in death!</p>
<p class="t0">Most happy they! whom least his arts deceive.</p>
<p class="t0">One eye on Death, and one full fix&rsquo;d on heaven,</p>
<p class="t0">Becomes a mortal, and immortal man.</p>
<p class="t0">Long on his wiles a piqued and jealous spy,<span class="lnum"> 840</span></p>
<p class="t0">I&rsquo;ve seen, or dreamt I saw, the tyrant dress;</p>
<p class="t0">Lay by his horrors, and put on his smiles.</p>
<p class="t0">Say, Muse, for thou remember&rsquo;st, call it back,</p>
<p class="t0">And show Lorenzo the surprising scene;</p>
<p class="t0">If &rsquo;twas a dream, his genius can explain.</p>
<p class="t">&rsquo;Twas in a circle of the gay I stood.</p>
<p class="t0">Death would have enter&rsquo;d; Nature push&rsquo;d him back;</p>
<p class="t0">Supported by a doctor of renown,</p>
<p class="t0">His point he gain&rsquo;d. Then artfully dismiss&rsquo;d</p>
<p class="t0">The sage; for Death design&rsquo;d to be conceal&rsquo;d.<span class="lnum"> 850</span></p>
<p class="t0">He gave an old vivacious usurer</p>
<p class="t0">His meagre aspect, and his naked bones;</p>
<p class="t0">In gratitude for plumping up his prey,</p>
<p class="t0">A pamper&rsquo;d spendthrift; whose fantastic air,</p>
<p class="t0">Well-fashion&rsquo;d figure, and cockaded<sup><a id="fr_25" href="#fn_25">[25]</a></sup> brow,</p>
<p class="t0">He took in change, and underneath the pride</p>
<p class="t0">Of costly linen, tuck&rsquo;d his filthy shroud.</p>
<p class="t0">His crooked bow he straighten&rsquo;d to a cane;</p>
<p class="t0">And hid his deadly shafts in Myra&rsquo;s eye.</p>
<p class="t">The dreadful masquerader, thus equipp&rsquo;d,<span class="lnum"> 860</span></p>
<p class="t0">Out sallies on adventures. Ask you where?</p>
<p class="t0">Where is he not? For his peculiar haunts,</p>
<p class="t0">Let this suffice; sure as night follows day,</p>
<p class="t0">Death treads in pleasure&rsquo;s footsteps round the world,<span class="lnum"> 864</span></p>
<p class="t0">When pleasure treads the paths, which reason shuns.</p>
<p class="t0">When, against reason, riot shuts the door,</p>
<p class="t0">And gaiety supplies the place of sense,</p>
<p class="t0">Then, foremost at the banquet, and the ball,</p>
<p class="t0">Death leads the dance, or stamps the deadly die;</p>
<p class="t0">Nor ever fails the midnight bowl to crown.<span class="lnum"> 870</span></p>
<p class="t0">Gaily carousing to his gay compeers,</p>
<p class="t0">Inly he laughs, to see them laugh at him,</p>
<p class="t0">As absent far: and when the revel burns,</p>
<p class="t0">When fear is banish&rsquo;d, and triumphant thought,</p>
<p class="t0">Calling for all the joys beneath the moon,</p>
<p class="t0">Against him turns the key; and bids him sup</p>
<p class="t0">With their progenitors&mdash;He drops his mask;</p>
<p class="t0">Frowns out at full; they start, despair, expire.</p>
<p class="t">Scarce with more sudden terror and surprise,</p>
<p class="t0">From his black mask of nitre, touch&rsquo;d by fire,<span class="lnum"> 880</span></p>
<p class="t0">He bursts, expands, roars, blazes, and devours.</p>
<p class="t0">And is not this triumphant treachery,</p>
<p class="t0">And more than simple conquest, in the fiend?</p>
<p class="t">And now, Lorenzo, dost thou wrap thy soul</p>
<p class="t0">In soft security, because unknown</p>
<p class="t0">Which moment is commission&rsquo;d to destroy?</p>
<p class="t0">In death&rsquo;s uncertainty thy danger lies.</p>
<p class="t0">Is death uncertain? Therefore thou be fix&rsquo;d;</p>
<p class="t0">Fix&rsquo;d as a sentinel, all eye, all ear,</p>
<p class="t0">All expectation of the coming foe.<span class="lnum"> 890</span></p>
<p class="t0">Rouse, stand in arms, nor lean against thy spear;</p>
<p class="t0">Lest slumber steal one moment o&rsquo;er thy soul,</p>
<p class="t0">And Fate surprise thee nodding. Watch, be strong:</p>
<p class="t0">Thus give each day the merit, and renown,</p>
<p class="t0">Of dying well; though doom&rsquo;d but once to die.</p>
<p class="t0">Nor let life&rsquo;s period hidden (as from most)</p>
<p class="t0">Hide too from thee the precious use of life.</p>
<p class="t">Early, not sudden, was Narcissa&rsquo;s fate.<span class="lnum"> 898</span></p>
<p class="t0">Soon, not surprising, Death his visit paid.</p>
<p class="t0">Her thought went forth to meet him on his way,</p>
<p class="t0">Nor gaiety forgot it was to die:</p>
<p class="t0">Though Fortune too (our third and final theme),</p>
<p class="t0">As an accomplice, play&rsquo;d her gaudy plumes,</p>
<p class="t0">And every glittering gewgaw, on her sight,<span class="lnum"> 904</span></p>
<p class="t0">To dazzle, and debauch it from its mark.</p>
<p class="t0">Death&rsquo;s dreadful advent is the mark of man;</p>
<p class="t0">And every thought that misses it, is blind.</p>
<p class="t0">Fortune, with youth and gaiety, conspired</p>
<p class="t0">To weave a triple wreath of happiness</p>
<p class="t0">(If happiness on earth) to crown her brow.<span class="lnum"> 910</span></p>
<p class="t0">And could Death charge through such a shining shield?</p>
<p class="t">That shining shield invites the tyrant&rsquo;s spear.</p>
<p class="t0">As if to damp our elevated aims,</p>
<p class="t0">And strongly preach humility to man.</p>
<p class="t0">O how portentous is prosperity!</p>
<p class="t0">How, comet-like, it threatens, while it shines!</p>
<p class="t0">Few years but yield us proof of Death&rsquo;s ambition,</p>
<p class="t0">To cull his victims from the fairest fold,</p>
<p class="t0">And sheath his shafts in all the pride of life.</p>
<p class="t0">When flooded with abundance, purpled o&rsquo;er<span class="lnum"> 920</span></p>
<p class="t0">With recent honours, bloom&rsquo;d with every bliss,</p>
<p class="t0">Set up in ostentation, made the gaze,</p>
<p class="t0">The gaudy centre, of the public eye,</p>
<p class="t0">When Fortune thus has toss&rsquo;d her child in air,</p>
<p class="t0">Snatch&rsquo;d from the covert of an humble state,</p>
<p class="t0">How often have I seen him dropp&rsquo;d at once,</p>
<p class="t0">Our morning&rsquo;s envy! and our evening&rsquo;s sigh!</p>
<p class="t0">As if her bounties were the signal given,</p>
<p class="t0">The flowery wreath to mark the sacrifice,</p>
<p class="t0">And call Death&rsquo;s arrows on the destined prey.<span class="lnum"> 930</span></p>
<p class="t">High Fortune seems in cruel league with Fate.</p>
<p class="t0">Ask you for what? To give his war on man<span class="lnum"> 932</span></p>
<p class="t0">The deeper dread, and more illustrious spoil;</p>
<p class="t0">Thus to keep daring mortals more in awe.</p>
<p class="t0">And burns Lorenzo still for the sublime</p>
<p class="t0">Of life? to hang his airy nest on high,</p>
<p class="t0">On the slight timber of the topmost bough,</p>
<p class="t0">Rock&rsquo;d at each breeze, and menacing a fall?</p>
<p class="t0">Granting grim Death at equal distance there;</p>
<p class="t0">Yet peace begins just where ambition ends.<span class="lnum"> 940</span></p>
<p class="t0">What makes man wretched? Happiness denied?</p>
<p class="t0">Lorenzo! no: &rsquo;tis happiness disdain&rsquo;d.</p>
<p class="t0">She comes too meanly dress&rsquo;d to win our smile;</p>
<p class="t0">And calls herself Content, a homely name!</p>
<p class="t0">Our flame is transport, and Content our scorn.</p>
<p class="t0">Ambition turns, and shuts the door against her,</p>
<p class="t0">And weds a toil, a tempest, in her stead;</p>
<p class="t0">A tempest to warm transport near of kin.</p>
<p class="t0">Unknowing what our mortal state admits,</p>
<p class="t0">Life&rsquo;s modest joys we ruin, while we raise;<span class="lnum"> 950</span></p>
<p class="t0">And all our ecstasies are wounds to peace;</p>
<p class="t0">Peace, the full portion of mankind below.</p>
<p class="t">And since thy peace is dear, ambitious youth!</p>
<p class="t0">Of fortune fond! as thoughtless of thy fate!</p>
<p class="t0">As late I drew Death&rsquo;s picture, to stir up</p>
<p class="t0">Thy wholesome fears; now, drawn in contrast, see</p>
<p class="t0">Gay Fortune&rsquo;s, thy vain hopes to reprimand.</p>
<p class="t0">See, high in air, the sportive goddess hangs,</p>
<p class="t0">Unlocks her casket, spreads her glittering ware,</p>
<p class="t0">And calls the giddy winds to puff abroad<span class="lnum"> 960</span></p>
<p class="t0">Her random bounties o&rsquo;er the gaping throng.</p>
<p class="t0">All rush rapacious; friends o&rsquo;er trodden friends;</p>
<p class="t0">Sons o&rsquo;er their fathers, subjects o&rsquo;er their kings,</p>
<p class="t0">Priests o&rsquo;er their gods, and lovers o&rsquo;er the fair</p>
<p class="t0">(Still more adored), to snatch the golden shower.</p>
<p class="t">Gold glitters most, where virtue shines no more;</p>
<p class="t0">As stars from absent suns have leave to shine.<span class="lnum"> 967</span></p>
<p class="t0">O what a precious pack of votaries<sup><a id="fr_26" href="#fn_26">[26]</a></sup></p>
<p class="t0">Unkennell&rsquo;d from the prisons, and the stews,</p>
<p class="t0">Pour in, all opening in their idol&rsquo;s praise;</p>
<p class="t0">All, ardent, eye each wafture of her hand,</p>
<p class="t0">And, wide-expanding their voracious jaws,</p>
<p class="t0">Morsel on morsel swallow down unchew&rsquo;d,<span class="lnum"> 973</span></p>
<p class="t0">Untasted, through mad appetite for more;</p>
<p class="t0">Gorged to the throat, yet lean and ravenous still.</p>
<p class="t0">Sagacious all, to trace the smallest game,</p>
<p class="t0">And bold to seize the greatest. If (bless&rsquo;d chance!)</p>
<p class="t0">Court-zephyrs sweetly breathe, they launch, they fly,</p>
<p class="t0">O&rsquo;er just, o&rsquo;er sacred, all-forbidden ground,</p>
<p class="t0">Drunk with the burning scent of place or power,<span class="lnum"> 980</span></p>

<p class="t">Or, if for men you take them, as I mark</p>

<p class="t0">With aim mismeasured, and impetuous speed,</p>
<p class="t0">Some darting, strike their ardent wish far off,</p>
<p class="t0">Through fury to possess it: some succeed,</p>
<p class="t0">But stumble, and let fall the taken prize.</p>
<p class="t0">From some, by sudden blasts, &rsquo;tis whirl&rsquo;d away,</p>
<p class="t0">And lodged in bosoms that ne&rsquo;er dreamt of gain.</p>
<p class="t0">To some it sticks so close, that, when torn off,<span class="lnum"> 990</span></p>
<p class="t0">Torn is the man, and mortal is the wound.</p>
<p class="t0">Some, o&rsquo;er-enamour&rsquo;d of their bags, run mad,</p>
<p class="t0">Groan under gold, yet weep for want of bread.</p>
<p class="t0">Together some (unhappy rivals!) seize,</p>
<p class="t0">And rend abundance into poverty;</p>
<p class="t0">Loud croaks the raven of the law, and smiles:</p>
<p class="t0">Smiles too the goddess; but smiles most at those</p>
<p class="t0">(Just victims of exorbitant desire!)</p>
<p class="t0">Who perish at their own request, and, whelm&rsquo;d</p>
<p class="t0">Beneath her load of lavish grants, expire.<span class="lnum"> 1000</span></p>

<p class="t0">Though various for a while their fates; at last</p>
<p class="t0">One curse involves them all: at Death&rsquo;s approach,</p>

<p class="t0">And mourn, in just proportion to their store.</p>
<p class="t">And Death&rsquo;s approach (if orthodox my song)</p>

<p class="t0">And art thou still a glutton of bright gold?</p>
<p class="t0">And art thou still rapacious of thy ruin?<span class="lnum"> 1010</span></p>
<p class="t0">Death loves a shining mark, a signal blow;</p>
<p class="t0">A blow, which, while it executes, alarms;</p>
<p class="t0">And startles thousands with a single fall.</p>
<p class="t0">As when some stately growth of oak, or pine,</p>

<p class="t0">A quiver, which, suspended in mid-air,</p>

<p class="t0">Can fancy form more finish&rsquo;d happiness?</p>

<h4>PREFACE.</h4>
<p>Few ages have been deeper in dispute about religion than this. The dispute
about religion, and the practice of it, seldom go together. The shorter, therefore,
the dispute, the better. I think it may be reduced to this single question, <i>Is
man immortal, or is he not?</i> If he is not, all our disputes are mere amusements,
or trials of skill. In this case, truth, reason, religion, which give our
discourses such pomp and solemnity, are (as will be shown) mere empty sound,
without any meaning in them. But if man is immortal, it will behove him to
be very serious about eternal consequences; or, in other words, to be truly
religious. And this great fundamental truth, unestablished, or unawakened in
the minds of men, is, I conceive, the real source and support of all our infidelity;
how remote soever the particular objections advanced may seem to be from it.</p>
<p>Sensible appearances affect most men much more than abstract reasonings;
and we daily see bodies drop around us, but the soul is invisible. The power
which inclination has over the judgment, is greater than can be well conceived
by those that have not had an experience of it; and of what numbers is it the
sad interest that souls should not survive! The heathen world confessed, that
they rather hoped, than firmly believed, immortality; and how many heathens
have we still amongst us! The sacred page assures us, that life and immortality
are brought to light by the Gospel: but by how many is the Gospel rejected or
overlooked? From these considerations, and from my being accidentally privy
to the sentiments of some particular persons, I have been long persuaded that
most, if not all, our infidels (whatever name they take, and whatever scheme,
for argument&rsquo;s sake, and to keep themselves in countenance, they patronise),
are supported in their deplorable error, by some doubt of their immortality, at
the bottom. And I am satisfied, that men once thoroughly convinced of their
immortality, are not far from being Christians. For it is hard to conceive,
that a man fully conscious eternal pain or happiness will certainly be his lot,
should not earnestly and impartially inquire after the surest means of escaping
the one, and securing the other. And of such an earnest and impartial inquiry
I well know the consequence.</p>
<p>Here, therefore, in proof of this most fundamental truth, some plain arguments
are offered; arguments derived from principles which infidels admit in common
with believers; arguments which appear to me altogether irresistible; and such
as, I am satisfied, will have great weight with all who give themselves the
<span class="pb" id="pg_158">[158]</span>
small trouble of looking seriously into their own bosoms, and of observing,
with any tolerable degree of attention, what daily passes round about them in
the world. If some arguments shall here occur, which others have declined,
they are submitted, with all deference, to better judgments in this, of all points
the most important. For, as to the being of a God, that is no longer disputed;
but it is undisputed for this reason only, viz., because, where the least pretence
to reason is admitted, it must for ever be indisputable. And of consequence
no man can be betrayed into a dispute of that nature by vanity; which has a
principal share in animating our modern combatants against other articles of
our belief.</p>

<h3>THE INFIDEL RECLAIMED.
<br /><span class="small">PART I.</span></h3>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">She<sup><a id="fr_28" href="#fn_28">[28]</a></sup> (for I know not yet her name in heaven),</p>
<p class="t0">Not early, like Narcissa, left the scene;</p>
<p class="t0">Nor sudden, like Philander. What avail?</p>
<p class="t0">This seeming mitigation but inflames;</p>
<p class="t0">This fancied medicine heightens the disease.</p>
<p class="t0">The longer known, the closer still she grew;</p>
<p class="t0">And gradual parting is a gradual death.</p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Tis the grim tyrant&rsquo;s engine, which extorts,</p>
<p class="t0">By tardy pressure&rsquo;s still-increasing weight,</p>
<p class="t0">From hardest hearts, confession of distress.<span class="lnum"> 10</span></p>
<p class="t">Oh, the long, dark approach through years of pain,</p>
<p class="t0">Death&rsquo;s gallery! (might I dare to call it so)</p>
<p class="t0">With dismal doubt, and sable terror, hung;</p>
<p class="t0">Sick hope&rsquo;s pale lamp its only glimmering ray:</p>
<p class="t0">There, fate my melancholy walk ordain&rsquo;d,</p>
<p class="t0">Forbid self-love itself to flatter, there.</p>
<p class="t0">How oft I gazed, prophetically sad!</p>
<p class="t0">How oft I saw her dead, while yet in smiles!<span class="lnum"> 18</span></p>
<p class="t0">In smiles she sunk her grief to lessen mine.</p>
<p class="t0">She spoke me comfort, and increased my pain.</p>
<p class="t0">Like powerful armies trenching at a town,</p>
<p class="t0">By slow, and silent, but resistless sap,</p>
<p class="t0">In his pale progress gently gaining ground,</p>
<p class="t0">Death urged his deadly siege; in spite of art,</p>
<p class="t0">Of all the balmy blessings nature lends</p>
<p class="t0">To succour frail humanity. Ye stars!</p>
<p class="t0">(Not now first made familiar to my sight)</p>
<p class="t0">And thou, O moon! bear witness, many a night</p>
<p class="t0">He tore the pillow from beneath my head,</p>
<p class="t0">Tied down my sore attention to the shock,<span class="lnum"> 30</span></p>
<p class="t0">By ceaseless depredations on a life</p>
<p class="t0">Dearer than that he left me. Dreadful post</p>
<p class="t0">Of observation! darker every hour!</p>
<p class="t0">Less dread the day that drove me to the brink,</p>
<p class="t0">And pointed at eternity below;</p>
<p class="t0">When my soul shudder&rsquo;d at futurity;</p>
<p class="t0">When, on a moment&rsquo;s point, th&rsquo; important die</p>
<p class="t0">Of life and death spun doubtful, ere it fell,</p>
<p class="t0">And turn&rsquo;d up life; my title to more woe.</p>
<p class="t">But why more woe? More comfort let it be.<span class="lnum"> 40</span></p>
<p class="t0">Nothing is dead, but that which wish&rsquo;d to die;</p>
<p class="t0">Nothing is dead, but wretchedness and pain;</p>
<p class="t0">Nothing is dead, but what encumber&rsquo;d, gall&rsquo;d,</p>
<p class="t0">Block&rsquo;d up the pass, and barr&rsquo;d from real life.</p>
<p class="t0">Where dwells that wish most ardent of the wise?</p>
<p class="t0">Too dark the sun to see it; highest stars</p>
<p class="t0">Too low to reach it; Death, great Death alone,</p>
<p class="t0">O&rsquo;er stars and sun, triumphant, lands us there.</p>
<p class="t">Nor dreadful our transition; though the mind,</p>
<p class="t0">An artist at creating self-alarms,<span class="lnum"> 50</span></p>
<p class="t0">Rich in expedients for inquietude,</p>
<p class="t0">Is prone to paint it dreadful. Who can take<span class="lnum"> 52</span></p>
<p class="t0">Death&rsquo;s portrait true? The tyrant never sat.</p>
<p class="t0">Our sketch all random strokes, conjecture all;</p>
<p class="t0">Close shuts the grave, nor tells one single tale.</p>
<p class="t0">Death, and his image rising in the brain,</p>
<p class="t0">Bear faint resemblance; never are alike;</p>
<p class="t0">Fear shakes the pencil; Fancy loves excess;</p>
<p class="t0">Dark Ignorance is lavish of her shades:</p>
<p class="t0">And these the formidable picture draw.<span class="lnum"> 60</span></p>
<p class="t">But grant the worst; &rsquo;tis past; new prospects rise;</p>
<p class="t0">And drop a veil eternal o&rsquo;er her tomb.</p>
<p class="t0">Far other views our contemplation claim,</p>
<p class="t0">Views that o&rsquo;erpay the rigours of our life;</p>
<p class="t0">Views that suspend our agonies in death.</p>
<p class="t0">Wrapt in the thought of immortality,</p>
<p class="t0">Wrapt in the single, the triumphant thought!</p>
<p class="t0">Long life might lapse, age unperceived come on;</p>
<p class="t0">And find the soul unsated with her theme.</p>
<p class="t0">Its nature, proof, importance, fire my song.<span class="lnum"> 70</span></p>
<p class="t0">O that my song could emulate my soul!</p>
<p class="t0">Like her, immortal. No!&mdash;the soul disdains</p>
<p class="t0">A mark so mean; far nobler hope inflames;</p>
<p class="t0">If endless ages can outweigh an hour,</p>
<p class="t0">Let not the laurel, but the palm, inspire.</p>
<p class="t">Thy nature, Immortality! who knows?</p>
<p class="t0">And yet who knows it not? It is but life</p>
<p class="t0">In stronger thread of brighter colour spun,</p>
<p class="t0">And spun for ever; dipp&rsquo;d by cruel Fate</p>
<p class="t0">In Stygian dye, how black, how brittle here!<span class="lnum"> 80</span></p>
<p class="t0">How short our correspondence with the sun!</p>
<p class="t0">And while it lasts, inglorious! Our best deeds,</p>
<p class="t0">How wanting in their weight! our highest joys</p>
<p class="t0">Small cordials to support us in our pain,</p>
<p class="t0">And give us strength to suffer. But how great</p>
<p class="t0">To mingle interests, converse, amities,<span class="lnum"> 86</span></p>
<p class="t0">With all the sons of Reason, scatter&rsquo;d wide</p>
<p class="t0">Through habitable space, wherever born,</p>
<p class="t0">Howe&rsquo;er endow&rsquo;d! to live free citizens</p>
<p class="t0">Of universal nature! to lay hold</p>
<p class="t0">By more than feeble faith on the Supreme!</p>
<p class="t0">To call heaven&rsquo;s rich unfathomable mines</p>
<p class="t0">(Mines, which support archangels in their state)<span class="lnum"> 93</span></p>
<p class="t0">Our own! To rise in science, as in bliss,</p>
<p class="t0">Initiate in the secrets of the skies!</p>
<p class="t0">To read creation; read its mighty plan</p>
<p class="t0">In the bare bosom of the Deity!</p>
<p class="t0">The plan, and execution, to collate!</p>
<p class="t0">To see, before each glance of piercing thought,</p>
<p class="t0">All cloud, all shadow, blown remote; and leave<span class="lnum"> 100</span></p>
<p class="t0">No mystery&mdash;but that of Love Divine,</p>
<p class="t0">Which lifts us on the seraph&rsquo;s flaming wing,</p>
<p class="t0">From earth&rsquo;s Aceldama, this field of blood,</p>
<p class="t0">Of inward anguish, and of outward ill,</p>
<p class="t0">From darkness, and from dust, to such a scene!</p>
<p class="t0">Love&rsquo;s element! true joy&rsquo;s illustrious home!</p>
<p class="t0">From earth&rsquo;s sad contrast (now deplored) more fair!</p>
<p class="t0">What exquisite vicissitude of fate!</p>
<p class="t0">Bless&rsquo;d absolution of our blackest hour!</p>
<p class="t">Lorenzo, these are thoughts that make man Man,<span class="lnum"> 110</span></p>
<p class="t0">The wise illumine, aggrandize the great.</p>
<p class="t0">How great (while yet we tread the kindred clod,</p>
<p class="t0">And every moment fear to sink beneath</p>
<p class="t0">The clod we tread; soon trodden by our sons);</p>
<p class="t0">How great, in the wild whirl of Time&rsquo;s pursuits,</p>
<p class="t0">To stop, and pause, involved in high presage,</p>
<p class="t0">Through the long vista of a thousand years,</p>
<p class="t0">To stand contemplating our distant selves,</p>
<p class="t0">As in a magnifying mirror seen,</p>
<p class="t0">Enlarged, ennobled, elevate, divine!<span class="lnum"> 120</span></p>
<p class="t0">To prophesy our own futurities;</p>
<p class="t0">To gaze in thought on what all thought transcends!</p>
<p class="t0">To talk, with fellow-candidates, of joys</p>
<p class="t0">As far beyond conception as desert,</p>
<p class="t0">Ourselves th&rsquo; astonish&rsquo;d talkers, and the tale!</p>
<p class="t">Lorenzo, swells thy bosom at the thought?</p>
<p class="t0">The swell becomes thee: &rsquo;tis an honest pride.</p>
<p class="t0">Revere thyself;&mdash;and yet thyself despise.</p>
<p class="t0">His nature no man can o&rsquo;er-rate; and none</p>
<p class="t0">Can under-rate his merit. Take good heed,<span class="lnum"> 130</span></p>
<p class="t0">Nor there be modest, where thou should&rsquo;st be proud;</p>
<p class="t0">That almost universal error shun.</p>
<p class="t0">How just our pride, when we behold those heights!</p>
<p class="t0">Not those Ambition paints in air, but those</p>
<p class="t0">Reason points out, and ardent Virtue gains,</p>
<p class="t0">And angels emulate; our pride how just!</p>
<p class="t0">When mount we? when these shackles cast? when quit</p>
<p class="t0">This cell of the creation? this small nest,</p>

<p class="t0">Fine-spun to sense; but gross and feculent</p>
<p class="t0">To souls celestial; souls ordain&rsquo;d to breathe</p>
<p class="t0">Ambrosial gales, and drink a purer sky;</p>
<p class="t0">Greatly triumphant on Time&rsquo;s farther shore,</p>

<p class="t0">The gust, the glow of rational delight,<span class="lnum"> 150</span></p>
<p class="t0">As on this theme, which angels praise and share?</p>
<p class="t0">Man&rsquo;s fates and favours are a theme in heaven.</p>
<p class="t">What wretched repetition cloys us here!</p>
<p class="t0">What periodic potions for the sick!<span class="lnum"> 154</span></p>
<p class="t0">Distemper&rsquo;d bodies! and distemper&rsquo;d minds!</p>

<p class="t0">And claim their laurel crowns, as well as we;</p>
<p class="t0">But not celestial. Here we stand alone;</p>
<p class="t0">As in our form, distinct, pre-eminent;</p>
<p class="t0">If prone in thought, our stature is our shame;</p>
<p class="t0">And man should blush, his forehead meets the skies.</p>
<p class="t0">The visible and present are for brutes,</p>

<p class="t0">The sage and hero of the fields and woods,</p>
<p class="t0">Asserts his rank, and rises into man.<span class="lnum"> 255</span></p>
<p class="t0">This is ambition: this is human fire.</p>
<p class="t">Can Parts or Place (two bold pretenders!) make</p>
<p class="t0">Lorenzo great, and pluck him from the throng?</p>
<p class="t">Genius and Art, ambition&rsquo;s boasted wings,</p>

<p class="t0">Heart merit wanting, mount we ne&rsquo;er so high,<span class="lnum"> 263</span></p>
<p class="t0">Our height is but the gibbet of our name.</p>
<p class="t0">A celebrated wretch, when I behold,</p>
<p class="t0">When I behold a genius bright, and base,</p>
<p class="t0">Of towering talents, and terrestrial aims;</p>
<p class="t0">Methinks I see, as thrown from her high sphere,</p>

<p class="t0">But wherefore envy? Talents angel-bright,</p>
<p class="t0">If wanting worth, are shining instruments</p>

<p class="t">Great ill is an achievement of great powers.</p>
<p class="t0">Plain sense but rarely leads us far astray.</p>

<p class="t0">Nor flatter Station: what is station high?</p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Tis a proud mendicant; it boasts, and begs;</p>
<p class="t0">It begs an alms of homage from the throng,<span class="lnum"> 289</span></p>
<p class="t0">And oft the throng denies its charity.</p>
<p class="t0">Monarchs and ministers, are awful names;</p>
<p class="t0">Whoever wear them, challenge our devoir.</p>
<p class="t0">Religion, public order, both exact</p>

<p class="t0">That pride, like hooded hawks, in darkness soars,</p>

<br />THE NATURE, PROOF, AND IMPORTANCE
<br />OF IMMORTALITY.</h3>
<hr />

<h4>PREFACE.</h4>
<p>As we are at war with the power, it were well if we were at war with the
manners, of France. A land of levity is a land of guilt. A serious mind is the
native soil of every virtue; and the single character that does true honour to
mankind. The soul&rsquo;s immortality has been the favourite theme with the serious
of all ages. Nor is it strange: it is a subject by far the most interesting and
important that can enter the mind of man. Of highest moment this subject
always was, and always will be. Yet this its highest moment seems to admit
of increase, at this day; a sort of occasional importance is superadded to
the natural weight of it; if that opinion which is advanced in the Preface to
the preceding Night be just. It is there supposed, that all our infidels, whatever
scheme, for argument&rsquo;s sake, and to keep themselves in countenance, they
patronise, are betrayed into their deplorable error, by some doubts of their immortality,
at the bottom. And the more I consider this point, the more I am
persuaded of the truth of that opinion. Though the distrust of a futurity is a
strange error; yet it is an error into which bad men may naturally be distressed.
For it is impossible to bid defiance to final ruin, without some refuge in
imagination, some presumption of escape. And what presumption is there?
There are but two in nature; but two, within the compass of human thought.
And these are,&mdash;That either God will not, or can not, punish. Considering the
divine attributes, the first is too gross to be digested by our strongest wishes.
And since omnipotence is as much a divine attribute as holiness, that God cannot
punish, is as absurd a supposition as the former. God certainly can punish
as long as wicked men exist. In non-existence, therefore, is their only refuge;
and, consequently, non-existence is their strongest wish. And strong wishes
have a strange influence on our opinions; they bias the judgment in a manner
almost incredible. And since on this member of their alternative, there are
some very small appearances in their favour, and none at all on the other, they
catch at this reed, they lay hold on this chimera, to save themselves from the
shock and horror of an immediate and absolute despair.</p>
<p>On reviewing my subject, by the light which this argument, and others of
like tendency, threw upon it, I was more inclined than ever to pursue it, as it
appeared to me to strike directly at the main root of all our infidelity. In the
following pages it is, accordingly, pursued at large; and some arguments for
immortality, new at least to me, are ventured on in them. There also the
writer has made an attempt to set the gross absurdities and horrors of annihilation
in a fuller and more affecting view than is (I think) to be met with
elsewhere.</p>
<p>The gentlemen, for whose sake this attempt was chiefly made, profess great
admiration for the wisdom of heathen antiquity: what pity it is they are not
sincere! If they were sincere, how would it mortify them to consider, with
what contempt and abhorrence their notions would have been received by those
whom they so much admire! What degree of contempt and abhorrence would
fall to their share, may be conjectured by the following matter of fact (in my
opinion) extremely memorable. Of all their heathen worthies, Socrates (it is
well known) was the most guarded, dispassionate, and composed: yet this
great master of temper was angry; and angry at his last hour; and angry
with his friend; and angry for what deserved acknowledgment; angry for a
right and tender instance of true friendship towards him. Is not this surprising?
What could be the cause? The cause was for his honour; it was a truly
noble, though, perhaps, a too punctilious, regard for immortality. For his
friend asking him, with such an affectionate concern as became a friend,
&ldquo;where he should deposit his remains,&rdquo; it was resented by Socrates, as
implying a dishonourable supposition, that he could be so mean, as to have a
regard for anything, even in himself, that was not immortal.</p>
<p>This fact well considered, would make our infidels withdraw their admiration
from Socrates; or make them endeavour, by their imitation of this illustrious
example, to share his glory: and, consequently, it would incline them to
peruse the following pages with candour and impartiality; which is all I
desire; and that, for their sakes: for I am persuaded, that an unprejudiced
infidel must, necessarily, receive some advantageous impressions from them.</p>

<br /><span class="small">PART II.</span></h3>
<h5>CONTENTS.</h5>
<p class="bq">In the Sixth Night arguments were drawn, from Nature, in proof of Immortality:
here, others are drawn from Man: from his Discontent, ver. 29;
from his Passions and Powers, 63; from the gradual growth of Reason, 81;
from his fear of Death, 86; from the nature of Hope, 104; and of Virtue,
159, &amp;c.; from Knowledge and Love, as being the most essential properties
of the soul, 253; from the order of Creation, 290, &amp;c.; from the
nature of Ambition, 337, &amp;c.; Avarice, 460; Pleasure, 477. A digression
on the grandeur of the Passions, 521. Immortality alone renders our
present state intelligible, 545. An objection from the Stoics&rsquo; disbelief of
immortality answered, 585. Endless questions unresolvable, but on the
supposition of our immortality, 606. The natural, most melancholy, and
pathetic complaint of a worthy man, under the persuasion of no Futurity,
653, &amp;c. The gross absurdities and horrors of annihilation urged home
on Lorenzo, 843, &amp;c. The soul&rsquo;s vast importance, 992, &amp;c.; from whence
it arises, 1080. The Difficulty of being an Infidel, 1133; the Infamy, 1148;
the Cause, 1188; and the Character, 1203, of an Infidel state. What
true free-thinking is, 1218. The necessary punishment of the false, 1273.
Man&rsquo;s ruin is from himself, 1303. An Infidel accuses himself with guilt
and hypocrisy, and that of the worst sort, 1319. His obligation to Christians,
1337. What danger he incurs by Virtue, 1345. Vice recommended
to him, 1364. His high pretences to Virtue and Benevolence exploded,
1373. The Conclusion, on the nature of Faith, 1406; Reason, 1440; and
Hope, 1445; with an apology for this attempt, 1472.</p>

<p class="t0">If fit, with dim, illustrious to compare,</p>
<p class="t0">The sun&rsquo;s meridian with the soul of man.</p>
<p class="t0">To man, why, stepdame Nature! so severe?</p>
<p class="t0">Why thrown aside thy masterpiece half wrought,</p>
<p class="t0">While meaner efforts thy last hand enjoy?</p>
<p class="t0">Or, if abortively, poor man must die,</p>
<p class="t0">Nor reach, what reach he might, why die in dread?</p>
<p class="t0">Why cursed with foresight? wise to misery?</p>
<p class="t0">Why of his proud prerogative the prey?</p>
<p class="t0">Why less pre-eminent in rank than pain?<span class="lnum"> 100</span></p>
<p class="t0">His immortality alone can tell;</p>
<p class="t0">Full ample fund to balance all amiss,<span class="lnum"> 102</span></p>
<p class="t0">And turn the scale in favour of the just!</p>
<p class="t">His immortality alone can solve</p>
<p class="t0">The darkest of enigmas, human hope;</p>
<p class="t0">Of all the darkest, if at death we die.</p>
<p class="t0">Hope, eager Hope, th&rsquo; assassin of our joy,</p>
<p class="t0">All present blessings treading under foot,</p>
<p class="t0">Is scarce a milder tyrant than Despair.</p>
<p class="t0">With no past toils content, still planting new,<span class="lnum"> 110</span></p>
<p class="t0">Hope turns us o&rsquo;er to death alone for ease.</p>
<p class="t0">Possession, why more tasteless than pursuit?</p>
<p class="t0">Why is a wish far dearer than a crown?</p>
<p class="t0">That wish accomplish&rsquo;d, why the grave of bliss?</p>
<p class="t0">Because, in the great future buried deep,</p>
<p class="t0">Beyond our plans of empire and renown,</p>
<p class="t0">Lies all that man with ardour should pursue;</p>
<p class="t0">And He who made him, bent him to the right.</p>
<p class="t">Man&rsquo;s heart th&rsquo; Almighty to the future sets,</p>
<p class="t0">By secret and inviolable springs;<span class="lnum"> 120</span></p>
<p class="t0">And makes his hope his sublunary joy.</p>
<p class="t0">Man&rsquo;s heart eats all things, and is hungry still;</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;More, more!&rdquo; the glutton cries: for something new</p>
<p class="t0">So rages appetite, if man can&rsquo;t mount,</p>
<p class="t0">He will descend. He starves on the possess&rsquo;d.</p>
<p class="t0">Hence, the world&rsquo;s master, from ambition&rsquo;s spire,</p>
<p class="t0">In Caprea plunged; and dived beneath the brute.</p>
<p class="t0">In that rank sty why wallow&rsquo;d empire&rsquo;s son</p>
<p class="t0">Supreme? Because he could no higher fly;</p>
<p class="t0">His riot was ambition in despair.<span class="lnum"> 130</span></p>
<p class="t">Old Rome consulted birds; Lorenzo! thou</p>
<p class="t0">With more success, the flight of Hope survey;</p>
<p class="t0">Of restless Hope, for ever on the wing.</p>
<p class="t0">High perch&rsquo;d o&rsquo;er every thought that falcon sits,</p>
<p class="t0">To fly at all that rises in her sight;</p>
<p class="t0">And never stooping, but to mount again<span class="lnum"> 136</span></p>
<p class="t0">Next moment, she betrays her aim&rsquo;s mistake,</p>
<p class="t0">And owns her quarry lodged beyond the grave.</p>
<p class="t">There should it fail us (it must fail us there,</p>
<p class="t0">If being fails), more mournful riddles rise,</p>
<p class="t0">And Virtue vies with Hope in mystery.</p>
<p class="t0">Why Virtue? where its praise, its being, fled?</p>
<p class="t0">Virtue is true self-interest pursued:<span class="lnum"> 143</span></p>
<p class="t0">What true self-interest of quite-mortal man?</p>
<p class="t0">To close with all that makes him happy here.</p>
<p class="t0">If vice (as sometimes) is our friend on earth,</p>
<p class="t0">Then vice is virtue; &rsquo;tis our sovereign good.</p>
<p class="t0">In self-applause is virtue&rsquo;s golden prize;</p>
<p class="t0">No self-applause attends it on thy scheme:</p>
<p class="t0">Whence self-applause? From conscience of the right.</p>
<p class="t0">And what is right, but means of happiness?<span class="lnum"> 151</span></p>
<p class="t0">No means of happiness when virtue yields;</p>
<p class="t0">That basis failing, falls the building too,</p>
<p class="t0">And lays in ruin every virtuous joy.</p>
<p class="t">The rigid guardian of a blameless heart,</p>
<p class="t0">So long revered, so long reputed wise,</p>
<p class="t0">Is weak; with rank knight-errantries o&rsquo;errun.</p>
<p class="t0">Why beats thy bosom with illustrious dreams</p>
<p class="t0">Of self-exposure, laudable, and great?</p>
<p class="t0">Of gallant enterprise, and glorious death?<span class="lnum"> 160</span></p>
<p class="t0">Die for thy country!&mdash;Thou romantic fool!</p>
<p class="t0">Seize, seize the plank thyself, and let her sink:</p>
<p class="t0">Thy country! what to thee?&mdash;the Godhead, what?</p>
<p class="t0">(I speak with awe!) though He should bid thee bleed?</p>
<p class="t0">If, with thy blood, thy final hope is spilt,</p>
<p class="t0">Nor can Omnipotence reward the blow,</p>
<p class="t0">Be deaf; preserve thy being; disobey.</p>
<p class="t">Nor is it disobedience: know, Lorenzo!</p>
<p class="t0">Whate&rsquo;er th&rsquo; Almighty&rsquo;s subsequent command,</p>
<p class="t0">His first command is this:&mdash;&ldquo;Man, love thyself.&rdquo;<span class="lnum"> 170</span></p>
<p class="t0">In this alone, free agents are not free.</p>
<p class="t0">Existence is the basis, bliss the prize;</p>
<p class="t0">If virtue costs existence, &rsquo;tis a crime;</p>
<p class="t0">Bold violation of our law supreme,</p>
<p class="t0">Black suicide; though nations, which consult</p>
<p class="t0">Their gain, at thy expence, resound applause.</p>
<p class="t">Since Virtue&rsquo;s recompence is doubtful, here,</p>
<p class="t0">If man dies wholly, well may we demand,</p>
<p class="t0">Why is man suffer&rsquo;d to be good in vain?</p>
<p class="t0">Why to be good in vain, is man enjoin&rsquo;d?<span class="lnum"> 180</span></p>
<p class="t0">Why to be good in vain, is man betray&rsquo;d?</p>
<p class="t0">Betray&rsquo;d by traitors lodged in his own breast,</p>
<p class="t0">By sweet complacencies from virtue felt?</p>
<p class="t0">Why whispers Nature lies on Virtue&rsquo;s part?</p>
<p class="t0">Or if blind Instinct (which assumes the name</p>
<p class="t0">Of sacred conscience) plays the fool in man,</p>
<p class="t0">Why Reason made accomplice in the cheat?</p>
<p class="t0">Why are the wisest loudest in her praise?</p>
<p class="t0">Can man by Reason&rsquo;s beam be led astray?</p>
<p class="t0">Or, at his peril, imitate his God?<span class="lnum"> 190</span></p>
<p class="t0">Since virtue sometimes ruins us on earth,</p>
<p class="t0">Or both are true, or man survives the grave.</p>
<p class="t">Or man survives the grave, or own, Lorenzo,</p>
<p class="t0">Thy boast supreme, a wild absurdity.</p>
<p class="t0">Dauntless thy spirit; cowards are thy scorn.</p>
<p class="t0">Grant man immortal, and thy scorn is just.</p>
<p class="t0">The man immortal, rationally brave,</p>
<p class="t0">Dares rush on death&mdash;because he cannot die.</p>
<p class="t0">But if man loses all, when life is lost,</p>
<p class="t0">He lives a coward, or a fool expires.<span class="lnum"> 200</span></p>

<p class="t0">Of all earth&rsquo;s madmen, most deserves a chain.</p>
<p class="t">When to the grave we follow the renown&rsquo;d</p>
<p class="t0">For valour, virtue, science, all we love,</p>
<p class="t0">And all we praise; for worth, whose noontide beam,</p>

<p class="t0">Why was he wise to know, and warm to praise,</p>

<p class="t0">The Mind Almighty? Could it be, that Fate,</p>
<p class="t0">Just when the lineaments began to shine,</p>
<p class="t0">And dawn the Deity, should snatch the draught,</p>
<p class="t0">With night eternal blot it out, and give</p>

<p class="t">If human souls, why not angelic too</p>

<p class="t0">O&rsquo;er ghastly ruin, frowning from his throne?</p>
<p class="t0">Shall we this moment gaze on God in man?</p>
<p class="t0">The next, lose man for ever in the dust?</p>
<p class="t0">From dust we disengage, or man mistakes;</p>
<p class="t0">And there, where least his judgment fears a flaw.</p>
<p class="t0">Wisdom and worth, how boldly he commends!</p>
<p class="t0">Wisdom and worth, are sacred names; revered,</p>
<p class="t0">Where not embraced; applauded; deified;</p>
<p class="t0">Why not compassion&rsquo;d too? If spirits die,</p>
<p class="t0">Both are calamities, inflicted both,<span class="lnum"> 230</span></p>
<p class="t0">To make us but more wretched: Wisdom&rsquo;s eye</p>
<p class="t0">Acute, for what? to spy more miseries;</p>
<p class="t0">And worth, so recompensed, new-points their stings.</p>
<p class="t0">Or man surmounts the grave, or gain is loss,</p>
<p class="t0">And worth exalted humbles us the more.</p>
<p class="t0">Thou wilt not patronise a scheme that makes<span class="lnum"> 236</span></p>
<p class="t0">Weakness and vice the refuge of mankind.</p>
<p class="t">&ldquo;Has virtue, then, no joys?&rdquo;&mdash;Yes, joys dear-bought.</p>
<p class="t0">Talk ne&rsquo;er so long, in this imperfect state,</p>

<p class="t0">Who virtue&rsquo;s self-reward so loud resound,<span class="lnum"> 243</span></p>
<p class="t0">Would take degrees angelic here below,</p>

<p class="t0">On earth&rsquo;s poor pay our famish&rsquo;d virtue dies.<span class="lnum"> 250</span></p>
<p class="t0">Truth incontestible! in spite of all</p>

<p class="t0">Dive to the bottom of his soul, the base</p>
<p class="t0">Sustaining all; what find we? knowledge, love.</p>
<p class="t0">As light and heat, essential to the sun,</p>

<p class="t0">And love unfeign&rsquo;d may purchase perfect hate.</p>
<p class="t0">Why starved, on earth, our angel appetites;</p>
<p class="t0">While brutal are indulged their fulsome fill?</p>
<p class="t0">Were then capacities divine conferr&rsquo;d,</p>
<p class="t0">As a mock-diadem, in savage sport,</p>
<p class="t0">Rank insult of our pompous poverty,</p>
<p class="t0">Which reaps but pain, from seeming claims so fair?</p>
<p class="t0">In future age lies no redress? and shuts</p>
<p class="t0">Eternity the door on our complaint?</p>

<p class="t0">The worst to wallow, and the best to weep;</p>

<p class="t">This cannot be. To love, and know, in man</p>

<p class="t0">Is Man the sole exception from her laws?</p>
<p class="t0">Eternity struck off from human hope</p>
<p class="t0">(I speak with truth, but veneration too),</p>
<p class="t0">Man is a monster, the reproach of Heaven,</p>

<p class="t0">All order. Go, mock-majesty! go, man!</p>

<p class="t0">Each virtue brings in hand a golden dower,<span class="lnum"> 320</span></p>
<p class="t0">Far richer in reversion: Hope exults;</p>
<p class="t0">And though much bitter in our cup is thrown,</p>

<p class="t0">O wherefore is the Deity so kind?</p>
<p class="t0">Astonishing beyond astonishment!</p>
<p class="t0">Heaven our reward&mdash;for heaven enjoy&rsquo;d below.</p>
<p class="t">Still unsubdued thy stubborn heart?&mdash;for there</p>
<p class="t0">The traitor lurks who doubts the truth I sing.</p>

<p class="t0">What, in that stubborn heart, if I should find<span class="lnum"> 330</span></p>
<p class="t0">New, unexpected witnesses against thee?</p>

<p class="t0">Canst thou suspect what makes us disbelieve</p>

<p class="t">First, then, Ambition summon to the bar.</p>
<p class="t0">Ambition&rsquo;s shame, extravagance, disgust<span class="lnum"> 338</span></p>

<p class="t0">Has made the body tutor to the soul;</p>
<p class="t0">Heaven kindly gives our blood a moral flow;</p>
<p class="t0">Bids it ascend the glowing cheek, and there</p>

<p class="t0">While o&rsquo;er us, in tremendous judgment sit</p>
<p class="t0">Far more than man, with endless praise, and blame.</p>
<p class="t">Ambition&rsquo;s boundless appetite outspeaks</p>
<p class="t0">The verdict of its shame. When souls take fire</p>
<p class="t0">At high presumptions of their own desert,</p>
<p class="t0">One age is poor applause; the mighty shout,</p>
<p class="t0">The thunder by the living few begun,</p>

<p class="t0">Instinct points out an interest in hereafter;</p>
<p class="t0">But our blind reason sees not where it lies;</p>
<p class="t0">Or, seeing, gives the substance for the shade.</p>
<p class="t">Fame is the shade of immortality,</p>
<p class="t0">And in itself a shadow. Soon as caught,</p>
<p class="t0">Contemn&rsquo;d; it shrinks to nothing in the grasp.</p>
<p class="t0">Consult th&rsquo; ambitious, &rsquo;tis ambition&rsquo;s cure.</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;And is this all?&rdquo; cried C&aelig;sar at his height,</p>

<p class="t0">Observe him near, your envy will abate:<span class="lnum"> 372</span></p>
<p class="t0">Shamed at the disproportion vast, between</p>
<p class="t0">The passion and the purchase, he will sigh</p>
<p class="t0">At such success, and blush at his renown.</p>
<p class="t0">And why? Because far richer prize invites</p>
<p class="t0">His heart; far more illustrious glory calls:</p>
<p class="t0">It calls in whispers, yet the deafest hear.</p>
<p class="t">And can Ambition a fourth proof supply?</p>
<p class="t0">It can, and stronger than the former three;<span class="lnum"> 380</span></p>
<p class="t0">Yet quite o&rsquo;erlook&rsquo;d by some reputed wise.</p>

<p class="t0">Absurd the famed advice to Pyrrhus<sup><a id="fr_34" href="#fn_34">[34]</a></sup> given,</p>

<p class="t0">The praise of mortals, or the praise of Heaven.</p>
<p class="t">Nor absolutely vain is human praise,</p>

<p class="t0">Pleasure and Pride (bad masters!) share our hearts.</p>
<p class="t0">As love of pleasure is ordain&rsquo;d to guard</p>
<p class="t0">And feed our bodies, and extend our race;</p>
<p class="t0">The love of praise is planted to protect,</p>
<p class="t0">And propagate the glories of the mind.</p>
<p class="t0">What is it, but the love of praise, inspires,</p>
<p class="t0">Matures, refines, embellishes, exalts,</p>
<p class="t0">Earth&rsquo;s happiness? From that, the delicate,<span class="lnum"> 412</span></p>
<p class="t0">The grand, the marvellous, of civil life,</p>
<p class="t0">Want and convenience, underworkers, lay</p>
<p class="t0">The basis, on which love of glory builds.</p>
<p class="t0">Nor is thy life, O Virtue! less in debt</p>
<p class="t0">To praise, thy secret stimulating friend.</p>
<p class="t0">Were men not proud, what merit should we miss!</p>
<p class="t0">Pride made the virtues of the Pagan world.</p>
<p class="t0">Praise is the salt that seasons right to man,<span class="lnum"> 420</span></p>
<p class="t0">And whets his appetite for moral good.</p>
<p class="t0">Thirst of applause is Virtue&rsquo;s second guard;</p>
<p class="t0">Reason, her first; but reason wants an aid;</p>
<p class="t0">Our private reason is a flatterer;</p>
<p class="t0">Thirst of applause calls public judgment in,</p>
<p class="t0">To poise our own, to keep an even scale,</p>
<p class="t0">And give endanger&rsquo;d Virtue fairer play.</p>
<p class="t">Here a fifth proof arises, stronger still:</p>
<p class="t0">Why this so nice construction of our hearts?</p>
<p class="t0">These delicate moralities of sense;<span class="lnum"> 430</span></p>
<p class="t0">This constitutional reserve of aid</p>

<p class="t0">O how misspent were all these stratagems,</p>
<p class="t0">By skill divine inwoven in our frame!</p>
<p class="t0">Where are Heaven&rsquo;s holiness and mercy fled?</p>
<p class="t0">Laughs Heaven, at once, at Virtue, and at Man?</p>
<p class="t0">If not, why that discouraged, this destroy&rsquo;d?</p>
<p class="t">Thus far Ambition. What says Avarice?</p>
<p class="t0">This her chief maxim, which has long been thine:</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The wise and wealthy are the same,&rdquo;&mdash;I grant it.</p>
<p class="t0">To store up treasure with incessant toil,</p>
<p class="t0">This is man&rsquo;s province, this his highest praise.</p>
<p class="t0">To this great end keen Instinct stings him on.</p>
<p class="t0">To guide that instinct, Reason! is thy charge;<span class="lnum"> 450</span></p>

<p class="t0">A blunder follows; and blind Industry,</p>
<p class="t0">Gall&rsquo;d by the spur, but stranger to the course</p>
<p class="t0">(The course where stakes of more than gold are won),</p>
<p class="t0">O&rsquo;erloading, with the cares of distant age,</p>
<p class="t0">The jaded spirits of the present hour,</p>
<p class="t0">Provides for an eternity below.</p>
<p class="t">&ldquo;Thou shalt not covet,&rdquo; is a wise command;<span class="lnum"> 460</span></p>
<p class="t0">But bounded to the wealth the sun surveys:</p>
<p class="t0">Look farther, the command stands quite reversed,</p>
<p class="t0">And avarice is a virtue most divine.</p>
<p class="t0">Is faith a refuge for our happiness?</p>
<p class="t0">Most sure: and is it not for reason too?</p>
<p class="t0">Nothing this world unriddles, but the next.</p>
<p class="t0">Whence inextinguishable thirst of gain?</p>
<p class="t0">From inextinguishable life in man.</p>
<p class="t0">Man, if not meant, by worth, to reach the skies,</p>
<p class="t0">Had wanted wing to fly so far in guilt.<span class="lnum"> 470</span></p>
<p class="t0">Sour grapes, I grant, ambition, avarice,</p>
<p class="t0">Yet still their root is immortality:<span class="lnum"> 472</span></p>
<p class="t0">These its wild growths so bitter, and so base,</p>
<p class="t0">(Pain and reproach!) Religion can reclaim,</p>
<p class="t0">Refine, exalt, throw down their poisonous lee,</p>
<p class="t0">And make them sparkle in the bowl of bliss.</p>
<p class="t">See, the third witness laughs at bliss remote,</p>
<p class="t0">And falsely promises an Eden here:</p>
<p class="t0">Truth she shall speak for once, though prone to lie,</p>
<p class="t0">A common cheat, and Pleasure is her name.<span class="lnum"> 480</span></p>
<p class="t0">To Pleasure never was Lorenzo deaf;</p>
<p class="t0">Then hear her now, now first thy real friend.</p>
<p class="t">Since Nature made us not more fond than proud</p>
<p class="t0">Of happiness (whence hypocrites in joy!</p>
<p class="t0">Makers of mirth! artificers of smiles!),</p>
<p class="t0">Why should the joy most poignant sense affords,</p>
<p class="t0">Burn us with blushes, and rebuke our pride?&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">Those heaven-born blushes tell us man descends,</p>
<p class="t0">Even in the zenith of his earthly bliss:</p>
<p class="t0">Should Reason take her infidel repose,<span class="lnum"> 490</span></p>
<p class="t0">This honest instinct speaks our lineage high;</p>
<p class="t0">This instinct calls on darkness to conceal</p>
<p class="t0">Our rapturous relation to the stalls.</p>
<p class="t0">Our glory covers us with noble shame,</p>
<p class="t0">And he that&rsquo;s unconfounded, is unmann&rsquo;d.</p>
<p class="t0">The man that blushes, is not quite a brute.</p>
<p class="t0">Thus far with thee, Lorenzo, will I close:</p>
<p class="t0">Pleasure is good, and man for pleasure made;</p>
<p class="t0">But pleasure full of glory, as of joy;</p>
<p class="t0">Pleasure, which neither blushes, nor expires.<span class="lnum"> 500</span></p>
<p class="t">The witnesses are heard; the cause is o&rsquo;er;</p>
<p class="t0">Let Conscience file the sentence in her court,</p>
<p class="t0">Dearer than deeds that half a realm convey;</p>
<p class="t0">Thus seal&rsquo;d by Truth, th&rsquo; authentic record runs:</p>
<p class="t">&ldquo;Know all; know, infidels,&mdash;unapt to know!</p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Tis immortality your nature solves;<span class="lnum"> 506</span></p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Tis immortality deciphers man,</p>
<p class="t0">And opens all the mysteries of his make.</p>
<p class="t0">Without it, half his instincts are a riddle;</p>
<p class="t0">Without it, all his virtues are a dream.</p>
<p class="t0">His very crimes attest his dignity;</p>
<p class="t0">His sateless thirst of pleasure, gold, and fame,</p>

<p class="t0">Think not our passions from Corruption sprung,</p>

<p class="t0">That is their mistress, not their mother. All</p>
<p class="t0">(And justly) Reason deem divine: I see,</p>

<p class="t0">In Paradise itself they burn&rsquo;d as strong,</p>

<p class="t0">On trash, on toys, dethroned from high desire?</p>
<p class="t0">Yet still, through their disgrace, no feeble ray</p>
<p class="t0">Of greatness shines, and tells us whence they fell:</p>

<p class="t0">When Reason moderates the rein aright,</p>

<p class="t0">To strike this truth, through adamantine man?<span class="lnum"> 1120</span></p>
<p class="t0">If not all-adamant, Lorenzo! hear;</p>
<p class="t0">All is delusion; Nature is wrapt up,</p>
<p class="t0">In tenfold night, from Reason&rsquo;s keenest eye;</p>
<p class="t0">There&rsquo;s no consistence, meaning, plan, or end,</p>
<p class="t0">In all beneath the sun, in all above</p>
<p class="t0">(As far as man can penetrate), or heaven</p>
<p class="t0">Is an immense, inestimable prize;</p>
<p class="t0">Or all is nothing, or that prize is all.&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">And shall each toy be still a match for Heaven,</p>
<p class="t0">And full equivalent for groans below?<span class="lnum"> 1130</span></p>
<p class="t0">Who would not give a trifle to prevent</p>
<p class="t0">What he would give a thousand worlds to cure?</p>
<p class="t">Lorenzo! thou hast seen (if thine to see)</p>
<p class="t0">All nature, and her God (by nature&rsquo;s course,</p>
<p class="t0">And nature&rsquo;s course controll&rsquo;d), declare for me:</p>
<p class="t0">The skies above proclaim, &ldquo;Immortal man!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">And, &ldquo;Man immortal!&rdquo; all below resounds.</p>
<p class="t0">The world&rsquo;s a system of theology,</p>
<p class="t0">Read by the greatest strangers to the schools:</p>
<p class="t0">If honest, learn&rsquo;d; and sages o&rsquo;er a plough.<span class="lnum"> 1140</span></p>
<p class="t0">Is not, Lorenzo, then, imposed on thee</p>
<p class="t0">This hard alternative; or, to renounce</p>
<p class="t0">Thy reason, or thy sense; or, to believe?</p>
<p class="t0">What then is unbelief? &rsquo;Tis an exploit;</p>
<p class="t0">A strenuous enterprise: to gain it, man<span class="lnum"> 1145</span></p>
<p class="t0">Must burst through every bar of common sense,</p>
<p class="t0">Of common shame, magnanimously wrong:</p>
<p class="t0">And what rewards the sturdy combatant?</p>
<p class="t0">His prize, repentance; infamy, his crown.</p>
<p class="t">But wherefore infamy?&mdash;For want of faith,</p>
<p class="t0">Down the steep precipice of wrong he slides;</p>
<p class="t0">There&rsquo;s nothing to support him in the right.<span class="lnum"> 1152</span></p>
<p class="t0">Faith in the future wanting, is, at least</p>
<p class="t0">In embryo, every weakness, every guilt;</p>
<p class="t0">And strong temptation ripens it to birth.</p>
<p class="t0">If this life&rsquo;s gain invites him to the deed,</p>
<p class="t0">Why not his country sold, his father slain?</p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Tis virtue to pursue our good supreme;</p>
<p class="t0">And his supreme, his only good, is here.</p>
<p class="t0">Ambition, avarice, by the wise disdain&rsquo;d,<span class="lnum"> 1160</span></p>
<p class="t0">Is perfect wisdom, while mankind are fools,</p>
<p class="t0">And think a turf, or tombstone, covers all:</p>
<p class="t0">These find employment, and provide for Sense</p>
<p class="t0">A richer pasture, and a larger range;</p>
<p class="t0">And Sense by right divine ascends the throne,</p>
<p class="t0">When Virtue&rsquo;s prize and prospect are no more;</p>
<p class="t0">Virtue no more we think the will of Heaven.</p>
<p class="t0">Would Heaven quite beggar Virtue, if beloved?</p>
<p class="t">&ldquo;Has Virtue charms?&rdquo;&mdash;I grant her heavenly fair;</p>
<p class="t0">But if unportion&rsquo;d, all will Interest wed;<span class="lnum"> 1170</span></p>
<p class="t0">Though that our admiration, this our choice.</p>
<p class="t0">The virtues grow on immortality;</p>
<p class="t0">That root destroy&rsquo;d, they wither and expire.</p>
<p class="t0">A Deity believed, will nought avail;</p>
<p class="t0">Rewards and punishments make God adored;</p>
<p class="t0">And hopes and fears give Conscience all her power.</p>
<p class="t">As in the dying parent dies the child,</p>
<p class="t0">Virtue, with immortality, expires.</p>
<p class="t0">Who tells me he denies his soul immortal,<span class="lnum"> 1179</span></p>
<p class="t0">Whate&rsquo;er his boast, has told me, he&rsquo;s a knave.</p>
<p class="t0">His duty &rsquo;tis, to love himself alone;</p>
<p class="t0">Nor care though mankind perish, if he smiles.</p>
<p class="t0">Who thinks ere long the man shall wholly die,</p>
<p class="t0">Is dead already; nought but brute survives.</p>
<p class="t">And are there such?&mdash;Such candidates there are</p>
<p class="t0">For more than death; for utter loss of being,</p>
<p class="t0">Being, the basis of the Deity!</p>
<p class="t0">Ask you the cause?&mdash;The cause they will not tell:</p>
<p class="t0">Nor need they: oh the sorceries of Sense!</p>
<p class="t0">They work this transformation on the soul;<span class="lnum"> 1190</span></p>
<p class="t0">Dismount her, like the serpent at the fall,</p>
<p class="t0">Dismount her from her native wing (which soar&rsquo;d</p>
<p class="t0">Erewhile ethereal heights), and throw her down,</p>
<p class="t0">To lick the dust, and crawl in such a thought.</p>
<p class="t">Is it in words to paint you? O ye fallen!</p>
<p class="t0">Fallen from the wings of Reason, and of Hope!</p>
<p class="t0">Erect in stature, prone in appetite!</p>

<p class="t0">In exhalation soft, and die in air,</p>

<p class="t0">In the coarse drudgeries, and sinks of Sense,<span class="lnum"> 1213</span></p>
<p class="t0">Your souls have quite worn out the make of Heaven,</p>
<p class="t0">By vice new-cast, and creatures of your own:</p>
<p class="t0">But though you can deform, you can&rsquo;t destroy;</p>
<p class="t0">To curse, not uncreate, is all your power.</p>
<p class="t">Lorenzo! this black brotherhood renounce;</p>

<p class="t0">His mounting mind made long abode in heaven.</p>
<p class="t0">This is freethinking, unconfined to parts,</p>

<p class="t0">Those numerous worlds that throng the firmament,</p>

<p class="t">How small a part&mdash;of nothing, shall I say?</p>
<p class="t0">Why not?&mdash;Friends, our chief treasure! how they drop!</p>
<p class="t0">Lucia,<sup><a id="fr_39" href="#fn_39">[39]</a></sup> Narcissa fair, Philander, gone!</p>
<p class="t0">The grave, like fabled Cerberus, has oped</p>
<p class="t0">A triple mouth; and, in an awful voice,<span class="lnum"> 1260</span></p>
<p class="t0">Loud calls my soul, and utters all I sing.</p>
<p class="t0">How the world falls to pieces round about us,</p>
<p class="t0">And leaves us in a ruin of our joy!</p>
<p class="t0">What says this transportation of my friends?</p>
<p class="t0">It bids me love the place where now they dwell,</p>
<p class="t0">And scorn this wretched spot, they leave so poor.</p>
<p class="t0">Eternity&rsquo;s vast ocean lies before thee;</p>
<p class="t0">There, there, Lorenzo! thy Clarissa sails.</p>
<p class="t0">Give thy mind sea-room; keep it wide of earth,</p>
<p class="t0">That rock of souls immortal; cut thy cord;<span class="lnum"> 1270</span></p>
<p class="t0">Weigh anchor; spread thy sails; call every wind;</p>
<p class="t0">Eye thy great Pole-star; make the land of life.</p>
<p class="t">Two kinds of life has double-natured man,</p>
<p class="t0">And two of death; the last far more severe.</p>
<p class="t0">Life animal is nurtured by the sun;</p>
<p class="t0">Thrives on his bounties, triumphs in his beams.</p>
<p class="t0">Life rational subsists on higher food,</p>
<p class="t0">Triumphant in His beams, who made the day.</p>
<p class="t0">When we leave that sun, and are left by this</p>
<p class="t0">(The fate of all who die in stubborn guilt),<span class="lnum"> 1280</span></p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Tis utter darkness; strictly double death.</p>
<p class="t0">We sink by no judicial stroke of Heaven,</p>
<p class="t0">But nature&rsquo;s course; as sure as plummets fall.</p>
<p class="t0">Since God, or man, must alter, ere they meet</p>
<p class="t0">(Since light and darkness blend not in one sphere),</p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Tis manifest, Lorenzo! who must change.</p>
<p class="t">If, then, that double death should prove thy lot,</p>
<p class="t0">Blame not the bowels of the Deity;</p>
<p class="t0">Man shall be blest, as far as man permits.</p>
<p class="t0">Not man alone, all rationals, Heaven arms<span class="lnum"> 1290</span></p>
<p class="t0">With an illustrious, but tremendous, power</p>
<p class="t0">To counteract its own most gracious ends;</p>
<p class="t0">And this, of strict necessity, not choice;</p>
<p class="t0">That power denied, men, angels, were no more</p>
<p class="t0">But passive engines, void of praise, or blame.</p>
<p class="t0">A nature rational implies the power</p>
<p class="t0">Of being blest, or wretched, as we please;</p>
<p class="t0">Else idle Reason would have nought to do;</p>
<p class="t0">And he that would be barr&rsquo;d capacity</p>
<p class="t0">Of pain, courts incapacity of bliss.<span class="lnum"> 1300</span></p>
<p class="t0">Heaven wills our happiness, allows our doom;</p>
<p class="t0">Invites us ardently, but not compels.</p>
<p class="t0">Heaven but persuades, almighty man decrees;</p>
<p class="t0">Man is the maker of immortal fates.</p>
<p class="t0">Man falls by man, if finally he falls;</p>
<p class="t0">And fall he must, who learns from Death alone,</p>
<p class="t0">The dreadful secret,&mdash;that he lives for ever.</p>
<p class="t">Why this to thee?&mdash;thee yet, perhaps, in doubt</p>
<p class="t0">Of second life? But wherefore doubtful still?</p>
<p class="t0">Eternal life is nature&rsquo;s ardent wish:<span class="lnum"> 1310</span></p>
<p class="t0">What ardently we wish, we soon believe:</p>
<p class="t0">Thy tardy faith declares that wish destroy&rsquo;d:</p>
<p class="t0">What has destroy&rsquo;d it?&mdash;Shall I tell thee what?</p>
<p class="t0">When fear&rsquo;d the future, &rsquo;tis no longer wish&rsquo;d;<span class="lnum"> 1314</span></p>
<p class="t0">And, when unwish&rsquo;d, we strive to disbelieve.</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Thus infidelity our guilt betrays.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">Nor that the sole detection! blush, Lorenzo!</p>
<p class="t0">Blush for hypocrisy, if not for guilt.</p>
<p class="t0">The future fear&rsquo;d?&mdash;an infidel, and fear?</p>
<p class="t0">Fear what? a dream? a fable?&mdash;How thy dread,</p>
<p class="t0">Unwilling evidence, and therefore strong,</p>
<p class="t0">Affords my cause an undesign&rsquo;d support!<span class="lnum"> 1322</span></p>
<p class="t0">How disbelief affirms, what it denies!</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;It, unawares, asserts immortal life.&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">Surprising! infidelity turns out</p>
<p class="t0">A creed, and a confession of our sins:</p>
<p class="t0">Apostates, thus, are orthodox divines.</p>
<p class="t">Lorenzo! with Lorenzo clash no more;</p>
<p class="t0">Nor longer a transparent visor wear.</p>
<p class="t0">Think&rsquo;st thou, Religion only has her mask?<span class="lnum"> 1330</span></p>
<p class="t0">Our infidels are Satan&rsquo;s hypocrites,</p>
<p class="t0">Pretend the worst, and, at the bottom, fail.</p>
<p class="t0">When visited by thought (thought will intrude),</p>
<p class="t0">Like him they serve, they tremble, and believe.</p>
<p class="t0">Is there hypocrisy so foul as this?</p>
<p class="t0">So fatal to the welfare of the world?</p>
<p class="t0">What detestation, what contempt, their due!</p>
<p class="t0">And, if unpaid, be thank&rsquo;d for their escape</p>
<p class="t0">That Christian candour they strive hard to scorn.</p>
<p class="t0">If not for that asylum, they might find<span class="lnum"> 1340</span></p>
<p class="t0">A hell on earth; nor &rsquo;scape a worse below.</p>
<p class="t">With insolence, and impotence of thought,</p>
<p class="t0">Instead of racking fancy, to refute,</p>
<p class="t0">Reform thy manners, and the truth enjoy.&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">But shall I dare confess the dire result?</p>
<p class="t0">Can thy proud reason brook so black a brand?</p>
<p class="t0">From purer manners, to sublimer faith,</p>
<p class="t0">Is nature&rsquo;s unavoidable ascent;<span class="lnum"> 1348</span></p>
<p class="t0">An honest deist, where the Gospel shines,</p>
<p class="t0">Matured to nobler, in the Christian ends.</p>
<p class="t0">When that bless&rsquo;d change arrives, even cast aside</p>
<p class="t0">This song superfluous; life immortal strikes</p>
<p class="t0">Conviction, in a flood of light divine.</p>
<p class="t0">A Christian dwells, like Uriel,<sup><a id="fr_40" href="#fn_40">[40]</a></sup> in the sun;</p>
<p class="t0">Meridian evidence puts doubt to flight;</p>
<p class="t0">And ardent Hope anticipates the skies.</p>
<p class="t0">Of that bright sun, Lorenzo! scale the sphere;</p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Tis easy! it invites thee; it descends</p>
<p class="t0">From heaven to woo, and waft thee whence it came:</p>

<p class="t0">In aid to Reason was the goddess sent;</p>
<p class="t0">To call up all its strength by such a charm.</p>
<p class="t0">Pleasure, first, succours Virtue; in return,</p>
<p class="t0">Virtue gives Pleasure an eternal reign.</p>
<p class="t0">What, but the pleasure of food, friendship, faith,</p>
<p class="t0">Supports life natural, civil, and divine?</p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Tis from the pleasure of repast, we live;</p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Tis from the pleasure of applause, we please;<span class="lnum"> 650</span></p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Tis from the pleasure of belief, we pray</p>
<p class="t0">(All prayer would cease, if unbelieved the prize):</p>
<p class="t0">It serves ourselves, our species, and our God;</p>
<p class="t0">And to serve more, is past the sphere of man.</p>
<p class="t0">Glide, then, for ever, pleasure&rsquo;s sacred stream!</p>
<p class="t0">Through Eden, as Euphrates ran, it runs,</p>
<p class="t0">And fosters every growth of happy life;</p>
<p class="t0">Makes a new Eden where it flows;&mdash;but such</p>
<p class="t0">As must be lost, Lorenzo! by thy fall.</p>
<p class="t">&ldquo;What mean I by thy fall?&rdquo;&mdash;Thou&rsquo;lt shortly see,</p>
<p class="t0">While Pleasure&rsquo;s nature is at large display&rsquo;d;<span class="lnum"> 661</span></p>
<p class="t0">Already sung her origin, and ends.</p>
<p class="t0">Those glorious ends, by kind, or by degree,</p>
<p class="t0">When Pleasure violates, &rsquo;tis then a vice,</p>
<p class="t0">A vengeance too; it hastens into pain.</p>
<p class="t0">From due refreshment, life, health, reason, joy;</p>
<p class="t0">From wild excess, pain, grief, distraction, death;</p>
<p class="t0">Heaven&rsquo;s justice this proclaims, and that her love.</p>
<p class="t0">What greater evil can I wish my foe,</p>
<p class="t0">Than his full draught of pleasure, from a cask<span class="lnum"> 670</span></p>
<p class="t0">Unbroach&rsquo;d by just authority, ungauged</p>
<p class="t0">By temperance, by reason unrefined?</p>
<p class="t0">A thousand demons lurk within the lee.</p>
<p class="t0">Heaven, others, and ourselves! uninjured these,</p>
<p class="t0">Drink deep; the deeper, then, the more divine;</p>
<p class="t0">Angels are angels, from indulgence there;</p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Tis unrepenting pleasure makes a god.</p>
<p class="t">Dost think thyself a god from other joys?</p>
<p class="t0">A victim rather! shortly sure to bleed.</p>
<p class="t0">The wrong must mourn: can Heaven&rsquo;s appointments fail?</p>
<p class="t0">Can man outwit Omnipotence? strike out<span class="lnum"> 681</span></p>
<p class="t0">A self-wrought happiness unmeant by Him</p>
<p class="t0">Who made us, and the world we would enjoy?</p>
<p class="t0">Who forms an instrument, ordains from whence</p>
<p class="t0">Its dissonance, or harmony, shall rise.</p>
<p class="t0">Heaven bid the soul this mortal frame inspire!</p>
<p class="t0">Bid virtue&rsquo;s ray divine inspire the soul</p>
<p class="t0">With unprecarious flows of vital joy;</p>
<p class="t0">And, without breathing, man as well might hope</p>
<p class="t0">For life, as, without piety, for peace.<span class="lnum"> 690</span></p>
<p class="t">&ldquo;Is virtue, then, and piety the same?&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">No; piety is more; &rsquo;tis virtue&rsquo;s source;</p>
<p class="t0">Mother of every worth, as that of joy.</p>
<p class="t0">Men of the world this doctrine ill digest;</p>
<p class="t0">They smile at piety; yet boast aloud<span class="lnum"> 695</span></p>
<p class="t0">Good will to men; nor know they strive to part</p>
<p class="t0">What Nature joins; and thus confute themselves.</p>
<p class="t0">With piety begins all good on earth;</p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Tis the first-born of rationality.</p>
<p class="t0">Conscience, her first law broken, wounded lies;</p>
<p class="t0">Enfeebled, lifeless, impotent to good;</p>
<p class="t0">A feign&rsquo;d affection bounds her utmost power.<span class="lnum"> 702</span></p>
<p class="t0">Some we can&rsquo;t love, but for th&rsquo; Almighty&rsquo;s sake;</p>
<p class="t0">A foe to God was ne&rsquo;er true friend to man;</p>
<p class="t0">Some sinister intent taints all he does;</p>
<p class="t0">And, in his kindest actions, he&rsquo;s unkind.</p>
<p class="t">On piety, humanity is built;</p>
<p class="t0">And, on humanity, much happiness;</p>
<p class="t0">And yet still more on piety itself.</p>
<p class="t0">A soul in commerce with her God, is heaven;<span class="lnum"> 710</span></p>
<p class="t0">Feels not the tumults and the shocks of life;</p>
<p class="t0">The whirls of passions, and the strokes of heart.</p>
<p class="t0">A Deity believed, is joy begun;</p>
<p class="t0">A Deity adored, is joy advanced;</p>
<p class="t0">A Deity beloved, is joy matured.</p>
<p class="t0">Each branch of piety delight inspires;</p>
<p class="t0">Faith builds a bridge from this world to the next,</p>
<p class="t0">O&rsquo;er death&rsquo;s dark gulf, and all its horror hides;</p>
<p class="t0">Praise, the sweet exhalation of our joy,</p>
<p class="t0">That joy exalts, and makes it sweeter still;<span class="lnum"> 720</span></p>
<p class="t0">Prayer ardent opens heaven, lets down a stream</p>
<p class="t0">Of glory on the consecrated hour</p>
<p class="t0">Of man, in audience with the Deity.</p>
<p class="t0">Who worships the great God, that instant joins</p>
<p class="t0">The first in heaven, and sets his foot on hell.</p>
<p class="t">Lorenzo! when wast thou at church before?</p>
<p class="t0">Thou think&rsquo;st the service long: but is it just?</p>
<p class="t0">Though just, unwelcome: thou hadst rather tread</p>
<p class="t0">Unhallow&rsquo;d ground; the Muse, to win thine ear,<span class="lnum"> 729</span></p>
<p class="t0">Must take an air less solemn. She complies.</p>
<p class="t0">Good conscience! at the sound the world retires;</p>
<p class="t0">Verse disaffects it, and Lorenzo smiles:</p>
<p class="t0">Yet has she her seraglio full of charms;</p>
<p class="t0">And such as age shall heighten, not impair.</p>
<p class="t0">Art thou dejected? Is thy mind o&rsquo;ercast?</p>
<p class="t0">Amid her fair ones, thou the fairest choose,</p>
<p class="t0">To chase thy gloom.&mdash;&ldquo;Go, fix some weighty truth;</p>
<p class="t0">Chain down some passion; do some generous good;</p>
<p class="t0">Teach ignorance to see, or grief to smile;</p>
<p class="t0">Correct thy friend; befriend thy greatest foe;<span class="lnum"> 740</span></p>
<p class="t0">Or with warm heart, and confidence divine,</p>
<p class="t0">Spring up, and lay strong hold on Him who made thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">Thy gloom is scatter&rsquo;d, sprightly spirits flow;</p>
<p class="t0">Though wither&rsquo;d is thy vine, and harp unstrung.</p>
<p class="t">Dost call the bowl, the viol, and the dance,</p>
<p class="t0">Loud mirth, mad laughter? Wretched comforters!</p>
<p class="t0">Physicians! more than half of thy disease.</p>
<p class="t0">Laughter, though never censured yet as sin</p>
<p class="t0">(Pardon a thought that only seems severe),</p>
<p class="t0">Is half immoral: Is it much indulged?<span class="lnum"> 750</span></p>
<p class="t0">By venting spleen, or dissipating thought,</p>
<p class="t0">It shows a scorner, or it makes a fool;</p>
<p class="t0">And sins, as hurting others, or ourselves.</p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Tis pride, or emptiness, applies the straw,</p>
<p class="t0">That tickles little minds to mirth effuse;</p>
<p class="t0">Of grief approaching, the portentous sign!</p>
<p class="t0">The house of laughter makes a house of woe.</p>
<p class="t0">A man triumphant is a monstrous sight;</p>
<p class="t0">A man dejected is a sight as mean.</p>
<p class="t0">What cause for triumph, where such ills abound?<span class="lnum"> 760</span></p>
<p class="t0">What for dejection, where presides a Power,</p>
<p class="t0">Who call&rsquo;d us into being to be bless&rsquo;d?</p>
<p class="t0">So grieve, as conscious, grief may rise to joy;<span class="lnum"> 763</span></p>
<p class="t0">So joy, as conscious, joy to grief may fall.</p>
<p class="t0">Most true, a wise man never will be sad;</p>
<p class="t0">But neither will sonorous, bubbling mirth,</p>
<p class="t0">A shallow stream of happiness betray:</p>
<p class="t0">Too happy to be sportive, he&rsquo;s serene.</p>
<p class="t">Yet would&rsquo;st thou laugh (but at thy own expense),</p>
<p class="t0">This counsel strange should I presume to give&mdash;<span class="lnum"> 770</span></p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Retire, and read thy Bible, to be gay.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">There truths abound of sovereign aid to peace;</p>
<p class="t0">Ah! do not prize them less, because inspired,</p>
<p class="t0">As thou, and thine, are apt and proud to do.</p>
<p class="t0">If not inspired, that pregnant page had stood,</p>
<p class="t0">Time&rsquo;s treasure, and the wonder of the wise!</p>
<p class="t0">Thou think&rsquo;st, perhaps, thy soul alone at stake;</p>
<p class="t0">Alas!&mdash;should men mistake thee for a fool;&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">What man of taste for genius, wisdom, truth,</p>
<p class="t0">Though tender of thy fame, could interpose?<span class="lnum"> 780</span></p>
<p class="t0">Believe me, sense here acts a double part,</p>
<p class="t0">And the true critic is a Christian too.</p>
<p class="t">But these, thou think&rsquo;st, are gloomy paths to joy.&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">True joy in sunshine ne&rsquo;er was found at first;</p>
<p class="t0">They, first, themselves offend, who greatly please;</p>
<p class="t0">And travel only gives us sound repose.</p>
<p class="t0">Heaven sells all pleasure; effort is the price;</p>
<p class="t0">The joys of conquest, are the joys of man;</p>
<p class="t0">And glory the victorious laurel spreads</p>
<p class="t0">O&rsquo;er pleasure&rsquo;s pure, perpetual, placid stream.<span class="lnum"> 790</span></p>
<p class="t">There is a time, when toil must be preferr&rsquo;d,</p>
<p class="t0">Or joy, by mistimed fondness, is undone.</p>
<p class="t0">A man of pleasure, is a man of pains.</p>
<p class="t0">Thou wilt not take the trouble to be blest.</p>
<p class="t0">False joys, indeed, are born from want of thought;</p>
<p class="t0">From thoughts full bent, and energy, the true;</p>
<p class="t0">And that demands a mind in equal poise,<span class="lnum"> 797</span></p>
<p class="t0">Remote from gloomy grief, and glaring joy.</p>
<p class="t0">Much joy not only speaks small happiness,</p>
<p class="t0">But happiness that shortly must expire.</p>
<p class="t0">Can joy, unbottom&rsquo;d in reflection, stand?</p>
<p class="t0">And, in a tempest, can reflection live?</p>
<p class="t0">Can joy, like thine, secure itself an hour?</p>
<p class="t0">Can joy, like thine, meet accident unshock&rsquo;d?<span class="lnum"> 804</span></p>
<p class="t0">Or ope the door to honest poverty?</p>
<p class="t0">Or talk with threatening death, and not turn pale?</p>
<p class="t0">In such a world, and such a nature, these</p>
<p class="t0">Are needful fundamentals of delight:</p>
<p class="t0">These fundamentals give delight indeed;</p>
<p class="t0">Delight, pure, delicate, and durable;<span class="lnum"> 810</span></p>
<p class="t0">Delight, unshaken, masculine, divine;</p>
<p class="t0">A constant, and a sound, but serious joy.</p>
<p class="t">Is joy the daughter of severity?</p>
<p class="t0">It is:&mdash;yet far my doctrine from severe.</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Rejoice for ever:&rdquo; it becomes a man;</p>
<p class="t0">Exalts, and sets him nearer to the gods.</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Rejoice for ever!&rdquo; Nature cries, &ldquo;Rejoice!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">And drinks to man, in her nectareous cup,</p>
<p class="t0">Mix&rsquo;d up of delicates for every sense;</p>
<p class="t0">To the great Founder of the bounteous feast,<span class="lnum"> 820</span></p>
<p class="t0">Drinks glory, gratitude, eternal praise;</p>
<p class="t0">And he that will not pledge her, is a churl.</p>
<p class="t0">Ill firmly to support, good fully taste,</p>
<p class="t0">Is the whole science of felicity:</p>
<p class="t0">Yet sparing pledge: her bowl is not the best</p>
<p class="t0">Mankind can boast.&mdash;&ldquo;A rational repast;</p>
<p class="t0">Exertion, vigilance, a mind in arms,</p>
<p class="t0">A military discipline of thought,</p>
<p class="t0">To foil temptation in the doubtful field;</p>
<p class="t0">And ever-waking ardour for the right.&rdquo;<span class="lnum"> 830</span></p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Tis these, first give, then guard, a cheerful heart.<span class="lnum"> 831</span></p>
<p class="t0">Nought that is right, think little; well aware,</p>
<p class="t0">What reason bids, God bids; by His command</p>
<p class="t0">How aggrandized, the smallest thing we do!</p>
<p class="t0">Thus, nothing is insipid to the wise;</p>
<p class="t0">To thee, insipid all, but what is mad;</p>
<p class="t0">Joys season&rsquo;d high, and tasting strong of guilt.</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Mad! (thou reply&rsquo;st, with indignation fired);</p>
<p class="t0">Of ancient sages proud to tread the steps,</p>
<p class="t0">I follow Nature.&rdquo;&mdash;Follow Nature still,<span class="lnum"> 840</span></p>
<p class="t0">But look it be thine own: is Conscience, then,</p>
<p class="t0">No part of nature? Is she not supreme?</p>
<p class="t0">Thou regicide! Oh, raise her from the dead!</p>
<p class="t0">Then, follow Nature; and resemble God.</p>
<p class="t">When, spite of Conscience, pleasure is pursued,</p>
<p class="t0">Man&rsquo;s nature is unnaturally pleased:</p>
<p class="t0">And what&rsquo;s unnatural, is painful too</p>
<p class="t0">At intervals, and must disgust even thee!</p>
<p class="t0">The fact thou know&rsquo;st; but not, perhaps, the cause.</p>
<p class="t0">Virtue&rsquo;s foundations with the world&rsquo;s were laid;<span class="lnum"> 850</span></p>
<p class="t0">Heaven mix&rsquo;d her with our make, and twisted close</p>
<p class="t0">Her sacred interests with the strings of life.</p>
<p class="t0">Who breaks her awful mandate, shocks himself,</p>
<p class="t0">His better self: and is it greater pain,</p>
<p class="t0">Our soul should murmur, or our dust repine?</p>
<p class="t0">And one, in their eternal war, must bleed.</p>
<p class="t">If one must suffer, which should least be spared?</p>
<p class="t0">The pains of mind surpass the pains of sense:</p>
<p class="t0">Ask, then, the gout, what torment is in guilt.</p>
<p class="t0">The joys of sense to mental joys are mean:<span class="lnum"> 860</span></p>
<p class="t0">Sense on the present only feeds; the soul</p>
<p class="t0">On past, and future, forages for joy.</p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Tis hers, by retrospect, through time to range;</p>
<p class="t0">And forward time&rsquo;s great sequel to survey.</p>
<p class="t0">Could human courts take vengeance on the mind,<span class="lnum"> 865</span></p>
<p class="t0">Axes might rust, and racks and gibbets fall:</p>

<p class="t">Lorenzo! wilt thou never be a man?</p>
<p class="t0">The man is dead, who for the body lives,</p>
<p class="t0">Lured, by the beating of his pulse, to list</p>

<p class="t0">Thyself, first, know; then love: a self there is</p>

<p class="t0">While every virtue wounds it to the heart:</p>
<p class="t0">Humility degrades it, Justice robs,</p>
<p class="t0">Bless&rsquo;d Bounty beggars it, fair Truth betrays,</p>

<p class="t0">This self, when rival to the former, scorn;<span class="lnum"> 880</span></p>
<p class="t0">When not in competition, kindly treat,</p>
<p class="t0">Defend it, feed it:&mdash;but when Virtue bids,</p>

<p class="t0">And why? &rsquo;Tis love of pleasure bids thee bleed;</p>
<p class="t0">Comply, or own self-love extinct, or blind.</p>
<p class="t">For what is vice? self-love in a mistake:</p>
<p class="t0">A poor blind merchant buying joys too dear.</p>
<p class="t0">And virtue, what? &rsquo;tis self-love in her wits,</p>
<p class="t0">Quite skilful in the market of delight.</p>
<p class="t0">Self-love&rsquo;s good sense is love of that dread Power,<span class="lnum"> 890</span></p>
<p class="t0">From whom herself, and all she can enjoy.</p>
<p class="t0">Other self-love is but disguised self-hate;</p>
<p class="t0">More mortal than the malice of our foes;</p>
<p class="t0">A self-hate, now, scarce felt; then felt full sore,</p>
<p class="t0">When being, cursed; extinction, loud implored;</p>
<p class="t0">And every thing preferr&rsquo;d to what we are.</p>
<p class="t">Yet this self-love Lorenzo makes his choice;</p>

<p class="t0">How is his want of happiness betray&rsquo;d,<span class="lnum"> 899</span></p>
<p class="t0">By disaffection to the present hour!</p>

<p class="t0">Consistent wisdom ever wills the same;</p>
<p class="t0">Thy fickle wish is ever on the wing.</p>
<p class="t0">Sick of herself, is Folly&rsquo;s character,</p>

<p class="t0">&rsquo;Mid sands, and rocks, and storms, to cruise for pleasure;</p>
<p class="t0">If gain&rsquo;d, dear-bought; and better miss&rsquo;d than gain&rsquo;d.</p>
<p class="t0">Much pain must expiate, what much pain procured.</p>
<p class="t0">Fancy, and Sense, from an infected shore,</p>
<p class="t0">Thy cargo bring; and pestilence the prize.<span class="lnum"> 990</span></p>
<p class="t0">Then, such thy thirst (insatiable thirst!</p>
<p class="t0">By fond indulgence but inflamed the more!),</p>
<p class="t0">Fancy still cruises, when poor Sense is tired.</p>
<p class="t">Imagination is the Paphian shop,</p>
<p class="t0">Where feeble happiness, like Vulcan, lame,</p>
<p class="t0">Bids foul ideas, in their dark recess,</p>
<p class="t0">And hot as hell (which kindled the black fires),</p>
<p class="t0">With wanton art, those fatal arrows form,</p>
<p class="t0">Which murder all thy time, health, wealth, and fame.</p>
<p class="t0">Would&rsquo;st thou receive them, other thoughts there are,</p>
<p class="t0">On angel-wing, descending from above,<span class="lnum"> 1001</span></p>
<p class="t0">Which these, with art divine, would counterwork,</p>
<p class="t0">And form celestial armour for thy peace.</p>
<p class="t">In this is seen Imagination&rsquo;s guilt;</p>
<p class="t0">But who can count her follies? She betrays thee,</p>
<p class="t0">To think in grandeur there is something great.</p>
<p class="t0">For works of curious art, and ancient fame,</p>
<p class="t0">Thy genius hungers, elegantly pain&rsquo;d;</p>
<p class="t0">And foreign climes must cater for thy taste.</p>
<p class="t0">Hence, what disaster!&mdash;Though the price was paid,<span class="lnum"> 1010</span></p>
<p class="t0">That persecuting priest, the Turk of Rome,</p>
<p class="t0">Whose foot (ye gods!) though cloven, must be kiss&rsquo;d,</p>
<p class="t0">Detain&rsquo;d thy dinner on the Latian shore;</p>
<p class="t0">(Such is the fate of honest Protestants!)</p>
<p class="t0">And poor Magnificence is starved to death.</p>
<p class="t0">Hence just resentment, indignation, ire!&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">Be pacified: if outward things are great,</p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Tis magnanimity great things to scorn;</p>
<p class="t0">Pompous expenses, and parades august,</p>
<p class="t0">And courts, that insalubrious soil to peace.<span class="lnum"> 1020</span></p>
<p class="t0">True happiness ne&rsquo;er enter&rsquo;d at an eye;</p>
<p class="t0">True happiness resides in things unseen.</p>
<p class="t0">No smiles of Fortune ever bless&rsquo;d the bad,</p>
<p class="t0">Nor can her frowns rob Innocence of joys;</p>
<p class="t0">That jewel wanting, triple crowns are poor:</p>
<p class="t0">So tell his Holiness, and be revenged.</p>
<p class="t">Pleasure, we both agree, is man&rsquo;s chief good;</p>
<p class="t0">Our only contest, what deserves the name.</p>
<p class="t0">Give Pleasure&rsquo;s name to nought, but what has pass&rsquo;d</p>
<p class="t0">Th&rsquo; authentic seal of Reason (which like Yorke,<sup><a id="fr_49" href="#fn_49">[49]</a></sup><span class="lnum"> 1030</span></p>
<p class="t0">Demurs on what it passes), and defies</p>
<p class="t0">The tooth of time; when past, a pleasure still;</p>
<p class="t0">Dearer on trial, lovelier for its age,<span class="lnum"> 1033</span></p>
<p class="t0">And doubly to be prized, as it promotes</p>
<p class="t0">Our future, while it forms our present, joy.</p>
<p class="t0">Some joys the future overcast; and some</p>
<p class="t0">Throw all their beams that way, and gild the tomb.</p>
<p class="t0">Some joys endear eternity; some give</p>
<p class="t0">Abhorr&rsquo;d annihilation dreadful charms.</p>
<p class="t0">Are rival joys contending for thy choice?<span class="lnum"> 1040</span></p>
<p class="t0">Consult thy whole existence, and be safe;</p>
<p class="t0">That oracle will put all doubt to flight.</p>
<p class="t0">Short is the lesson, though my lecture long;</p>
<p class="t0">Be good&mdash;and let Heaven answer for the rest.</p>
<p class="t">Yet, with a sigh o&rsquo;er all mankind, I grant</p>
<p class="t0">In this our day of proof, our land of hope,</p>
<p class="t0">The good man has his clouds that intervene;</p>
<p class="t0">Clouds, that obscure his sublunary day,</p>
<p class="t0">But never conquer: even the best must own,</p>
<p class="t0">Patience, and resignation, are the pillars<span class="lnum"> 1050</span></p>
<p class="t0">Of human peace on earth. The pillars, these:</p>
<p class="t0">But those of Seth not more remote from thee,</p>
<p class="t0">Till this heroic lesson thou hast learn&rsquo;d;</p>
<p class="t0">To frown at pleasure, and to smile in pain.</p>
<p class="t0">Fired at the prospect of unclouded bliss,</p>
<p class="t0">Heaven in reversion, like the sun, as yet</p>
<p class="t0">Beneath th&rsquo; horizon, cheers us in this world;</p>
<p class="t0">It sheds, on souls susceptible of light,</p>
<p class="t0">The glorious dawn of our eternal day.</p>
<p class="t">&ldquo;This (says Lorenzo) is a fair harangue:<span class="lnum"> 1060</span></p>
<p class="t0">But can harangues blow back strong nature&rsquo;s stream;</p>
<p class="t0">Or stem the tide Heaven pushes through our veins,</p>
<p class="t0">Which sweeps away man&rsquo;s impotent resolves,</p>
<p class="t0">And lays his labour level with the world?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t">Themselves men make their comment on mankind;</p>
<p class="t0">And think nought is, but what they find at home:</p>
<p class="t0">Thus, weakness to chimera turns the truth.<span class="lnum"> 1067</span></p>
<p class="t0">Nothing romantic has the Muse prescribed.</p>
<p class="t0">Above,<sup><a id="fr_50" href="#fn_50">[50]</a></sup> Lorenzo saw the man of earth,</p>
<p class="t0">The mortal man; and wretched was the sight.</p>
<p class="t0">To balance that, to comfort, and exalt,</p>
<p class="t0">Now see the man immortal: him, I mean,</p>
<p class="t0">Who lives as such; whose heart, full bent on heaven,</p>
<p class="t0">Leans all that way, his bias to the stars.</p>
<p class="t0">The world&rsquo;s dark shades, in contrast set, shall raise</p>
<p class="t0">His lustre more; though bright, without a foil:</p>
<p class="t0">Observe his awful portrait, and admire;</p>
<p class="t0">Nor stop at wonder; imitate, and live.</p>
<p class="t">Some angel guide my pencil, while I draw,</p>
<p class="t0">What nothing less than angel can exceed!<span class="lnum"> 1080</span></p>
<p class="t0">A man on earth devoted to the skies;</p>
<p class="t0">Like ships in sea, while in, above the world.</p>
<p class="t">With aspect mild, and elevated eye,</p>
<p class="t0">Behold him seated on a mount serene,</p>
<p class="t0">Above the fogs of sense, and passion&rsquo;s storm;</p>
<p class="t0">All the black cares, and tumults, of this life,</p>
<p class="t0">Like harmless thunders, breaking at his feet,</p>
<p class="t0">Excite his pity, not impair his peace.</p>
<p class="t0">Earth&rsquo;s genuine sons, the sceptred, and the slave,</p>
<p class="t0">A mingled mob! a wandering herd! he sees,<span class="lnum"> 1090</span></p>
<p class="t0">Bewilder&rsquo;d in the vale; in all unlike!</p>
<p class="t0">His full reverse in all! What higher praise?</p>
<p class="t0">What stronger demonstration of the right?</p>
<p class="t">The present all their care; the future, his.</p>
<p class="t0">When public welfare calls, or private want,</p>
<p class="t0">They give to fame; his bounty he conceals.</p>
<p class="t0">Their virtues varnish nature; his exalt.</p>
<p class="t0">Mankind&rsquo;s esteem they court; and he, his own.</p>
<p class="t0">Theirs, the wild chase of false felicities;</p>
<p class="t0">His, the composed possession of the true.<span class="lnum"> 1100</span></p>
<p class="t0">Alike throughout is his consistent peace,</p>
<p class="t0">All of one colour, and an even thread;</p>
<p class="t0">While party-colour&rsquo;d shreds of happiness,</p>
<p class="t0">With hideous gaps between, patch up for them</p>
<p class="t0">A madman&rsquo;s robe; each puff of Fortune blows</p>
<p class="t0">The tatters by, and shows their nakedness.</p>
<p class="t">He sees with other eyes than theirs: where they</p>
<p class="t0">Behold a sun, he spies a Deity;</p>
<p class="t0">What makes them only smile, makes him adore.</p>
<p class="t0">Where they see mountains, he but atoms sees;<span class="lnum"> 1110</span></p>
<p class="t0">An empire, in his balance, weighs a grain.</p>
<p class="t0">They things terrestrial worship, as divine:</p>
<p class="t0">His hopes immortal blow them by, as dust,</p>
<p class="t0">That dims his sight, and shortens his survey,</p>
<p class="t0">Which longs, in infinite, to lose all bound.</p>
<p class="t0">Titles and honours (if they prove his fate)</p>
<p class="t0">He lays aside to find his dignity;</p>
<p class="t0">No dignity they find in aught besides.</p>
<p class="t0">They triumph in externals (which conceal</p>
<p class="t0">Man&rsquo;s real glory), proud of an eclipse.<span class="lnum"> 1120</span></p>
<p class="t0">Himself too much he prizes to be proud,</p>
<p class="t0">And nothing thinks so great in man, as man.</p>
<p class="t0">Too dear he holds his interest, to neglect</p>
<p class="t0">Another&rsquo;s welfare, or his right invade;</p>
<p class="t0">Their interest, like a lion, lives on prey.</p>
<p class="t0">They kindle at the shadow of a wrong:</p>
<p class="t0">Wrong he sustains with temper, looks on heaven,</p>
<p class="t0">Nor stoops to think his injurer his foe;</p>
<p class="t0">Nought, but what wounds his virtue, wounds his peace.</p>
<p class="t0">A cover&rsquo;d heart their character defends;<span class="lnum"> 1130</span></p>
<p class="t0">A cover&rsquo;d heart denies him half his praise.</p>
<p class="t0">With nakedness his innocence agrees;</p>
<p class="t0">While their broad foliage testifies their fall:</p>
<p class="t0">Their no joys end, where his full feast begins;<span class="lnum"> 1134</span></p>
<p class="t0">His joys create, theirs murder, future bliss.</p>
<p class="t0">To triumph in existence, his alone;</p>
<p class="t0">And his alone, triumphantly to think</p>
<p class="t0">His true existence is not yet begun.</p>
<p class="t0">His glorious course was, yesterday, complete;</p>
<p class="t0">Death, then, was welcome; yet life still is sweet.</p>
<p class="t">But nothing charms Lorenzo, like the firm,</p>
<p class="t0">Undaunted breast&mdash;and whose is that high praise?<span class="lnum"> 1142</span></p>
<p class="t0">They yield to pleasure, though they danger brave,</p>
<p class="t0">And show no fortitude, but in the field;</p>
<p class="t0">If there they show it, &rsquo;tis for glory shown;</p>
<p class="t0">Nor will that cordial always man their hearts.</p>
<p class="t0">A cordial his sustains, that cannot fail;</p>
<p class="t0">By pleasure unsubdued, unbroke by pain,</p>
<p class="t0">He shares in that Omnipotence he trusts.</p>
<p class="t0">All-bearing, all-attempting, till he falls;<span class="lnum"> 1150</span></p>
<p class="t0">And when he falls, writes VICI on his shield.</p>
<p class="t0">From magnanimity, all fear above;</p>
<p class="t0">From nobler recompence, above applause;</p>
<p class="t0">Which owes to man&rsquo;s short outlook all its charms.</p>
<p class="t">Backward to credit what he never felt,</p>
<p class="t0">Lorenzo cries,&mdash;&ldquo;Where shines this miracle?</p>
<p class="t0">From what root rises this immortal man?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">A root that grows not in Lorenzo&rsquo;s ground;</p>
<p class="t0">The root dissect, nor wonder at the flower.</p>
<p class="t0">He follows nature (not like thee) and shows us<span class="lnum"> 1160</span></p>
<p class="t0">An uninverted system of a man.</p>
<p class="t0">His appetite wears Reason&rsquo;s golden chain,</p>
<p class="t0">And finds, in due restraint, its luxury.</p>
<p class="t0">His passion, like an eagle well reclaim&rsquo;d,</p>
<p class="t0">Is taught to fly at nought, but infinite.</p>
<p class="t0">Patient his hope, unanxious is his care,</p>
<p class="t0">His caution fearless, and his grief (if grief</p>
<p class="t0">The gods ordain) a stranger to despair.<span class="lnum"> 1168</span></p>
<p class="t0">And why?&mdash;because affection, more than meet,</p>
<p class="t0">His wisdom leaves not disengaged from heaven.</p>
<p class="t0">Those secondary goods that smile on earth,</p>
<p class="t0">He, loving in proportion, loves in peace.</p>
<p class="t0">They most the world enjoy, who least admire.</p>
<p class="t0">His understanding &rsquo;scapes the common cloud</p>
<p class="t0">Of fumes, arising from a boiling breast.</p>
<p class="t0">His head is clear, because his heart is cool,</p>
<p class="t0">By worldly competitions uninflamed.</p>
<p class="t0">The moderate movements of his soul admit</p>
<p class="t0">Distinct ideas, and matured debate,</p>
<p class="t0">An eye impartial, and an even scale;<span class="lnum"> 1180</span></p>
<p class="t0">Whence judgment sound, and unrepenting choice.</p>
<p class="t0">Thus, in a double sense, the good are wise;</p>
<p class="t0">On its own dunghill, wiser than the world.</p>
<p class="t0">What, then, the world? It must be doubly weak;</p>
<p class="t0">Strange truth! as soon would they believe their creed.</p>
<p class="t">Yet thus it is; nor otherwise can be;</p>
<p class="t0">So far from aught romantic, what I sing.</p>
<p class="t0">Bliss has no being, virtue has no strength,</p>
<p class="t0">But from the prospect of immortal life.</p>
<p class="t0">Who think earth all, or (what weighs just the same)<span class="lnum"> 1190</span></p>
<p class="t0">Who care no farther, must prize what it yields;</p>
<p class="t0">Fond of its fancies, proud of its parades.</p>
<p class="t0">Who thinks earth nothing, can&rsquo;t its charms admire;</p>
<p class="t0">He can&rsquo;t a foe, though most malignant, hate,</p>
<p class="t0">Because that hate would prove his greater foe.</p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Tis hard for them (yet who so loudly boast</p>
<p class="t0">Good-will to men?) to love their dearest friend;</p>
<p class="t0">For may not he invade their good supreme,</p>
<p class="t0">Where the least jealousy turns love to gall?</p>
<p class="t0">All shines to them, that for a season shines.<span class="lnum"> 1200</span></p>
<p class="t0">Each act, each thought, he questions, &ldquo;What its weight,</p>
<p class="t0">Its colour what, a thousand ages hence?&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="lnum"> 1202</span></p>
<p class="t0">And what it there appears, he deems it now.</p>
<p class="t0">Hence, pure are the recesses of his soul.</p>
<p class="t0">The godlike man has nothing to conceal.</p>
<p class="t0">His virtue, constitutionally deep,</p>
<p class="t0">Has habit&rsquo;s firmness, and affection&rsquo;s flame;</p>
<p class="t0">Angels, allied, descend to feed the fire;</p>
<p class="t0">And Death, which others slays, makes him a god.</p>
<p class="t">And now, Lorenzo! bigot of this world!<span class="lnum"> 1210</span></p>
<p class="t0">Wont to disdain poor bigots caught by Heaven!</p>
<p class="t0">Stand by thy scorn, and be reduced to nought:</p>
<p class="t0">For what art thou?&mdash;Thou boaster! while thy glare,</p>
<p class="t0">Thy gaudy grandeur, and mere worldly worth,</p>
<p class="t0">Like a broad mist, at distance, strikes us most;</p>
<p class="t0">And, like a mist, is nothing when at hand;</p>
<p class="t0">His merit, like a mountain, on approach,</p>
<p class="t0">Swells more, and rises nearer to the skies,</p>
<p class="t0">By promise now, and, by possession, soon,</p>
<p class="t0">(Too soon, too much, it cannot be) his own.<span class="lnum"> 1220</span></p>
<p class="t">From this thy just annihilation rise,</p>
<p class="t0">Lorenzo! rise to something, by reply.</p>
<p class="t0">The world, thy client, listens, and expects;</p>
<p class="t0">And longs to crown thee with immortal praise.</p>
<p class="t0">Canst thou be silent? No; for Wit is thine;</p>
<p class="t0">And Wit talks most, when least she has to say,</p>
<p class="t0">And Reason interrupts not her career.</p>
<p class="t0">She&rsquo;ll say&mdash;that mists above the mountains rise;</p>
<p class="t0">And, with a thousand pleasantries, amuse;</p>
<p class="t0">She&rsquo;ll sparkle, puzzle, flutter, raise a dust,<span class="lnum"> 1230</span></p>
<p class="t0">And fly conviction, in the dust she raised.</p>
<p class="t">Wit, how delicious to man&rsquo;s dainty taste!</p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Tis precious, as the vehicle of sense;</p>
<p class="t0">But, as its substitute, a dire disease.</p>
<p class="t0">Pernicious talent! flatter&rsquo;d by the world,</p>
<p class="t0">By the blind world, which thinks the talent rare.<span class="lnum"> 1236</span></p>
<p class="t0">Wisdom is rare, Lorenzo! wit abounds;</p>
<p class="t0">Passion can give it; sometimes wine inspires</p>
<p class="t0">The lucky flash; and madness rarely fails.</p>
<p class="t0">Whatever cause the spirit strongly stirs,</p>
<p class="t0">Confers the bays, and rivals thy renown.</p>
<p class="t0">For thy renown, &rsquo;twere well was this the worst;</p>
<p class="t0">Chance often hits it; and, to pique thee more,<span class="lnum"> 1243</span></p>
<p class="t0">See Dulness, blundering on vivacities,</p>
<p class="t0">Shakes her sage head at the calamity,</p>
<p class="t0">Which has exposed, and let her down to thee.</p>
<p class="t0">But Wisdom, awful Wisdom! which inspects,</p>
<p class="t0">Discerns, compares, weighs, separates, infers,</p>
<p class="t0">Seizes the right, and holds it to the last;</p>
<p class="t0">How rare! In senates, synods, sought in vain;<span class="lnum"> 1250</span></p>
<p class="t0">Or if there found, &rsquo;tis sacred to the few;</p>
<p class="t0">While a lewd prostitute to multitudes,</p>
<p class="t0">Frequent, as fatal, Wit: in civil life,</p>
<p class="t0">Wit makes an enterpriser; Sense, a man.</p>
<p class="t0">Wit hates authority; commotion loves,</p>
<p class="t0">And thinks herself the lightning of the storm.</p>
<p class="t0">In states, &rsquo;tis dangerous; in religion, death:</p>
<p class="t0">Shall Wit turn Christian, when the dull believe?</p>
<p class="t0">Sense is our helmet, wit is but the plume;</p>
<p class="t0">The plume exposes, &rsquo;tis our helmet saves.<span class="lnum"> 1260</span></p>
<p class="t0">Sense is the diamond, weighty, solid, sound;</p>
<p class="t0">When cut by wit, it casts a brighter beam;</p>
<p class="t0">Yet, wit apart, it is a diamond still.</p>
<p class="t0">Wit, widow&rsquo;d of good sense, is worse than nought;</p>
<p class="t0">It hoists more sail to run against a rock.</p>
<p class="t0">Thus, a half-Chesterfield is quite a fool;</p>
<p class="t0">Whom dull fools scorn, and bless their want of wit.</p>
<p class="t">How ruinous the rock I warn thee shun,</p>
<p class="t0">Where syrens sit, to sing thee to thy fate!</p>
<p class="t0">A joy, in which our reason bears no part,<span class="lnum"> 1270</span></p>
<p class="t0">Is but a sorrow, tickling, ere it stings.</p>
<p class="t0">Let not the cooings of the world allure thee;</p>
<p class="t0">Which of her lovers ever found her true?</p>
<p class="t0">Happy! of this bad world who little know?&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">And yet, we much must know her, to be safe;</p>
<p class="t0">To know the world, not love her, is thy point;</p>
<p class="t0">She gives but little, nor that little, long.</p>
<p class="t0">There is, I grant, a triumph of the pulse;</p>
<p class="t0">A dance of spirits, a mere froth of joy,</p>
<p class="t0">Our thoughtless agitation&rsquo;s idle child,<span class="lnum"> 1280</span></p>
<p class="t0">That mantles high, that sparkles, and expires,</p>
<p class="t0">Leaving the soul more vapid than before.</p>
<p class="t0">An animal ovation! such as holds</p>
<p class="t0">No commerce with our reason, but subsists</p>
<p class="t0">On juices, through the well-toned tubes, well strain&rsquo;d;</p>
<p class="t0">A nice machine! scarce ever tuned aright;</p>
<p class="t0">And when it jars&mdash;thy syrens sing no more,</p>
<p class="t0">Thy dance is done; the demi-god is thrown</p>
<p class="t0">(Short apotheosis!) beneath the man,</p>
<p class="t0">In coward gloom immersed, or fell despair.<span class="lnum"> 1290</span></p>
<p class="t">Art thou yet dull enough despair to dread,</p>
<p class="t0">And startle at destruction? If thou art,</p>
<p class="t0">Accept a buckler, take it to the field;</p>
<p class="t0">(A field of battle is this mortal life!)</p>
<p class="t0">When danger threatens, lay it on thy heart;</p>
<p class="t0">A single sentence, proof against the world:</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Soul, body, fortune!&mdash;every good pertains</p>
<p class="t0">To one of these; but prize not all alike;</p>
<p class="t0">The goods of fortune to thy body&rsquo;s health,</p>
<p class="t0">Body to soul, and soul submit to God.&rdquo;<span class="lnum"> 1300</span></p>
<p class="t0">Would&rsquo;st thou build lasting happiness? do this;</p>
<p class="t0">Th&rsquo; inverted pyramid can never stand.</p>
<p class="t">Is this truth doubtful? It outshines the sun;</p>
<p class="t0">Nay, the sun shines not, but to show us this,<span class="lnum"> 1304</span></p>
<p class="t0">The single lesson of mankind on earth.</p>
<p class="t0">And yet&mdash;yet, what? No news! Mankind is mad;</p>
<p class="t0">Such mighty numbers list against the right,</p>
<p class="t0">(And what can&rsquo;t numbers, when bewitch&rsquo;d, achieve!)</p>
<p class="t0">They talk themselves to something like belief,</p>
<p class="t0">That all earth&rsquo;s joys are theirs: as Athens&rsquo; fool</p>
<p class="t0">Grinn&rsquo;d from the port, on every sail his own.</p>
<p class="t">They grin; but wherefore? and how long the laugh?</p>
<p class="t0">Half ignorance, their mirth; and half, a lie;<span class="lnum"> 1313</span></p>
<p class="t0">To cheat the world, and cheat themselves, they smile.</p>
<p class="t0">Hard either task! The most abandon&rsquo;d own,</p>
<p class="t0">That others, if abandon&rsquo;d, are undone:</p>
<p class="t0">Then, for themselves, the moment Reason wakes</p>
<p class="t0">(And Providence denies it long repose),</p>
<p class="t0">O how laborious is their gaiety!</p>
<p class="t0">They scarce can swallow their ebullient spleen,<span class="lnum"> 1320</span></p>
<p class="t0">Scarce muster patience to support the farce,</p>
<p class="t0">And pump sad laughter till the curtain falls.</p>
<p class="t0">Scarce, did I say? Some cannot sit it out;</p>
<p class="t0">Oft their own daring hands the curtain draw,</p>
<p class="t0">And show us what their joy, by their despair.</p>
<p class="t">The clotted hair! gored breast! blaspheming eye!</p>
<p class="t0">Its impious fury still alive in death!</p>
<p class="t0">Shut, shut the shocking scene.&mdash;But Heaven denies</p>
<p class="t0">A cover to such guilt; and so should man.</p>
<p class="t0">Look round, Lorenzo! see the reeking blade,<span class="lnum"> 1330</span></p>
<p class="t0">Th&rsquo; envenom&rsquo;d phial, and the fatal ball;</p>
<p class="t0">The strangling cord, and suffocating stream;</p>
<p class="t0">The loathsome rottenness, and foul decays</p>
<p class="t0">From raging riot (slower suicides!)</p>
<p class="t0">And pride in these, more execrable still!</p>
<p class="t0">How horrid all to thought!&mdash;but horrors, these,</p>
<p class="t0">That vouch the truth; and aid my feeble song.</p>
<p class="t">From vice, sense, fancy, no man can be blest:<span class="lnum"> 1338</span></p>
<p class="t0">Bliss is too great, to lodge within an hour:</p>
<p class="t0">When an immortal being aims at bliss,</p>
<p class="t0">Duration is essential to the name.</p>
<p class="t0">O for a joy from reason! joy from that,</p>
<p class="t0">Which makes man Man; and, exercised aright,</p>
<p class="t0">Will make him more: a bounteous joy! that gives</p>
<p class="t0">And promises; that weaves, with art divine,</p>
<p class="t0">The richest prospect into present peace:</p>
<p class="t0">A joy ambitious! joy in common held</p>
<p class="t0">With thrones ethereal, and their greater far;</p>
<p class="t0">A joy high privileged from chance, time, death!</p>
<p class="t0">A joy, which death shall double, judgment crown!<span class="lnum"> 1350</span></p>
<p class="t0">Crown&rsquo;d higher, and still higher, at each stage,</p>
<p class="t0">Through bless&rsquo;d eternity&rsquo;s long day; yet still,</p>
<p class="t0">Not more remote from sorrow, than from Him,</p>
<p class="t0">Whose lavish hand, whose love stupendous, pours</p>
<p class="t0">So much of Deity on guilty dust.</p>
<p class="t0">There, O my Lucia! may I meet thee there,</p>
<p class="t0">Where not thy presence can improve my bliss!</p>
<p class="t">Affects not this the sages of the world?</p>
<p class="t0">Can nought affect them, but what fools them too?</p>
<p class="t0">Eternity, depending on an hour,<span class="lnum"> 1360</span></p>
<p class="t0">Makes serious thought man&rsquo;s wisdom, joy, and praise,</p>
<p class="t0">Nor need you blush (though sometimes your designs</p>
<p class="t0">May shun the light) at your designs on heaven:</p>
<p class="t0">Sole point! where over-bashful is your blame.</p>
<p class="t0">Are you not wise?&mdash;You know you are: yet hear</p>
<p class="t0">One truth, amid your numerous schemes, mislaid,</p>
<p class="t0">Or overlook&rsquo;d, or thrown aside, if seen;</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Our schemes to plan by this world, or the next,</p>
<p class="t0">Is the sole difference between wise and fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">All worthy men will weigh you in this scale;<span class="lnum"> 1370</span></p>
<p class="t0">What wonder then, if they pronounce you light?<span class="lnum"> 1371</span></p>
<p class="t0">Is their esteem alone not worth your care?</p>
<p class="t0">Accept my simple scheme of common sense:</p>
<p class="t0">Thus, save your fame, and make two worlds your own.</p>
<p class="t">The world replies not;&mdash;but the world persists;</p>
<p class="t0">And puts the cause off to the longest day,</p>
<p class="t0">Planning evasions for the day of doom.</p>
<p class="t0">So far, at that re-hearing, from redress,</p>
<p class="t0">They then turn witnesses against themselves;</p>
<p class="t0">Hear that, Lorenzo! nor be wise to-morrow.<span class="lnum"> 1380</span></p>
<p class="t0">Haste, haste! a man, by nature, is in haste;</p>
<p class="t0">For who shall answer for another hour?</p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Tis highly prudent, to make one sure friend;</p>
<p class="t0">And that thou canst not do, this side the skies.</p>
<p class="t">Ye sons of earth! (nor willing to be more!)</p>
<p class="t0">Since verse you think from priestcraft somewhat free,</p>
<p class="t0">Thus, in an age so gay, the Muse plain truths</p>
<p class="t0">(Truths, which, at church, you might have heard in prose)</p>
<p class="t0">Has ventured into light; well pleased the verse</p>
<p class="t0">Should be forgot, if you the truths retain;<span class="lnum"> 1390</span></p>
<p class="t0">And crown her with your welfare, not your praise.</p>
<p class="t0">But praise she need not fear: I see my fate;</p>
<p class="t0">And headlong leap, like Curtius, down the gulf.</p>
<p class="t0">Since many an ample volume, mighty tome,</p>
<p class="t0">Must die; and die unwept; O thou minute</p>
<p class="t0">Devoted page! go forth among thy foes;</p>
<p class="t0">Go, nobly proud of martyrdom for truth,</p>
<p class="t0">And die a double death: mankind incensed,</p>
<p class="t0">Denies thee long to live: nor shalt thou rest,</p>
<p class="t0">When thou art dead; in Stygian shades arraign&rsquo;d<span class="lnum"> 1400</span></p>
<p class="t0">By Lucifer, as traitor to his throne;</p>
<p class="t0">And bold blasphemer of his friend,&mdash;the World;</p>
<p class="t0">The World, whose legions cost him slender pay,</p>
<p class="t0">And volunteers around his banner swarm;<span class="lnum"> 1404</span></p>
<p class="t0">Prudent, as Prussia,<sup><a id="fr_51" href="#fn_51">[51]</a></sup> in her zeal for Gaul.</p>
<p class="t">&ldquo;Are all, then, fools?&rdquo; Lorenzo cries.&mdash;Yes, all,</p>
<p class="t0">But such as hold this doctrine (new to thee);</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The mother of true wisdom is the will;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">The noblest intellect, a fool without it.</p>
<p class="t0">World-wisdom much has done, and more may do,<span class="lnum"> 1410</span></p>
<p class="t0">In arts and sciences, in wars, and peace:</p>
<p class="t0">But art and science, like thy wealth, will leave thee,</p>
<p class="t0">And make thee twice a beggar at thy death.</p>
<p class="t0">This is the most indulgence can afford;&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Thy wisdom all can do, but&mdash;make thee wise.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">Nor think this censure is severe on thee;</p>
<p class="t0">Satan, thy master, I dare call a dunce.<span class="lnum"> 1417</span></p>

<p class="center">NIGHT NINTH.</p>
<h3>THE CONSOLATION.</h3>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">As when a traveller, a long day past</p>
<p class="t0">In painful search of what he cannot find,</p>
<p class="t0">At night&rsquo;s approach, content with the next cot,</p>
<p class="t0">There ruminates, a while, his labour lost;</p>
<p class="t0">Then cheers his heart with what his fate affords,</p>
<p class="t0">And chants his sonnet to deceive the time,</p>
<p class="t0">Till the due season calls him to repose:</p>
<p class="t0">Thus I, long-travell&rsquo;d in the ways of men,</p>
<p class="t0">And dancing, with the rest, the giddy maze,</p>
<p class="t0">Where Disappointment smiles at Hope&rsquo;s career;<span class="lnum"> 10</span></p>
<p class="t0">Warn&rsquo;d by the languor of life&rsquo;s evening ray,</p>
<p class="t0">At length have housed me in an humble shed;</p>
<p class="t0">Where, future wandering banish&rsquo;d from my thought,</p>
<p class="t0">And waiting, patient, the sweet hour of rest,</p>
<p class="t0">I chase the moments with a serious song.</p>
<p class="t0">Song soothes our pains; and age has pains to soothe.</p>
<p class="t">When age, care, crime, and friends embraced at heart,</p>
<p class="t0">Torn from my bleeding breast, and death&rsquo;s dark shade,</p>
<p class="t0">Which hovers o&rsquo;er me, quench th&rsquo; ethereal fire;</p>
<p class="t0">Canst thou, O Night! indulge one labour more?<span class="lnum"> 20</span></p>
<p class="t0">One labour more indulge! then sleep, my strain!<span class="lnum"> 21</span></p>
<p class="t0">Till, haply, waked by Raphael&rsquo;s golden lyre,</p>
<p class="t0">Where night, death, age, care, crime, and sorrow, cease;</p>
<p class="t0">To bear a part in everlasting lays;</p>
<p class="t0">Though far, far higher set, in aim, I trust,</p>
<p class="t0">Symphonious to this humble prelude here.</p>
<p class="t">Has not the Muse asserted pleasures pure,</p>
<p class="t0">Like those above; exploding other joys?</p>
<p class="t0">Weigh what was urged, Lorenzo! fairly weigh;</p>
<p class="t0">And tell me, hast thou cause to triumph still?<span class="lnum"> 30</span></p>
<p class="t0">I think, thou wilt forbear a boast so bold.</p>
<p class="t0">But if, beneath the favour of mistake,</p>
<p class="t0">Thy smile&rsquo;s sincere; not more sincere can be</p>
<p class="t0">Lorenzo&rsquo;s smile, than my compassion for him.</p>
<p class="t0">The sick in body call for aid; the sick</p>
<p class="t0">In mind are covetous of more disease;</p>
<p class="t0">And when at worst, they dream themselves quite well.</p>
<p class="t0">To know ourselves diseased, is half our cure.</p>
<p class="t0">When Nature&rsquo;s blush by Custom is wiped off,</p>
<p class="t0">And Conscience, deaden&rsquo;d by repeated strokes,<span class="lnum"> 40</span></p>
<p class="t0">Has into manners naturalized our crimes;</p>
<p class="t0">The curse of curses is, our curse to love;</p>
<p class="t0">To triumph in the blackness of our guilt</p>
<p class="t0">(As Indians glory in the deepest jet),</p>
<p class="t0">And throw aside our senses with our peace.</p>
<p class="t">But grant no guilt, no shame, no least alloy;</p>
<p class="t0">Grant joy and glory quite unsullied shone;</p>
<p class="t0">Yet, still, it ill deserves Lorenzo&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p class="t0">No joy, no glory, glitters in thy sight,</p>
<p class="t0">But, through the thin partition of an hour,<span class="lnum"> 50</span></p>
<p class="t0">I see its sables wove by destiny;</p>
<p class="t0">And that in sorrow buried; this, in shame;</p>
<p class="t0">While howling furies wring the doleful knell;</p>
<p class="t0">And Conscience, now so soft thou scarce canst hear<span class="lnum"> 54</span></p>
<p class="t0">Her whisper, echoes her eternal peal.</p>
<p class="t">Where, the prime actors of the last year&rsquo;s scene;</p>
<p class="t0">Their port so proud, their buskin, and their plume?</p>
<p class="t0">How many sleep, who kept the world awake</p>
<p class="t0">With lustre, and with noise! has Death proclaim&rsquo;d</p>
<p class="t0">A truce, and hung his sated lance on high?</p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Tis brandish&rsquo;d still; nor shall the present year</p>
<p class="t0">Be more tenacious of her human leaf,<span class="lnum"> 62</span></p>
<p class="t0">Or spread of feeble life a thinner fall.</p>
<p class="t">But needless monuments to wake the thought;</p>
<p class="t0">Life&rsquo;s gayest scenes speak man&rsquo;s mortality;</p>
<p class="t0">Though in a style more florid, full as plain,</p>
<p class="t0">As mausoleums, pyramids, and tombs.</p>
<p class="t0">What are our noblest ornaments, but deaths</p>
<p class="t0">Turn&rsquo;d flatterers of life, in paint, or marble,</p>
<p class="t0">The well-stain&rsquo;d canvas, or the featured stone?<span class="lnum"> 70</span></p>
<p class="t0">Our fathers grace, or rather haunt, the scene.</p>
<p class="t0">Joy peoples her pavilion from the dead.</p>
<p class="t">&ldquo;Profess&rsquo;d diversions! cannot these escape?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">Far from it: these present us with a shroud;</p>
<p class="t0">And talk of death, like garlands o&rsquo;er a grave.</p>
<p class="t0">As some bold plunderers, for buried wealth,</p>
<p class="t0">We ransack tombs for pastime; from the dust</p>
<p class="t0">Call up the sleeping hero; bid him tread</p>
<p class="t0">The scene for our amusement: how like gods</p>
<p class="t0">We sit; and, wrapt in immortality,<span class="lnum"> 80</span></p>
<p class="t0">Shed generous tears on wretches born to die;</p>
<p class="t0">Their fate deploring, to forget our own!</p>
<p class="t">What all the pomps and triumphs of our lives,</p>
<p class="t0">But legacies in blossom? Our lean soil,</p>
<p class="t0">Luxuriant grown, and rank in vanities,</p>
<p class="t0">From friends interr&rsquo;d beneath; a rich manure!</p>
<p class="t0">Like other worms, we banquet on the dead;</p>
<p class="t0">Like other worms, shall we crawl on, nor know<span class="lnum"> 88</span></p>
<p class="t0">Our present frailties, or approaching fate?</p>
<p class="t">Lorenzo! such the glories of the world!</p>
<p class="t0">What is the world itself? thy world&mdash;a grave.</p>
<p class="t0">Where is the dust that has not been alive?</p>
<p class="t0">The spade, the plough, disturb our ancestors;</p>
<p class="t0">From human mould we reap our daily bread.</p>
<p class="t0">The globe around earth&rsquo;s hollow surface shakes,</p>
<p class="t0">And is the ceiling of her sleeping sons.</p>
<p class="t0">O&rsquo;er devastation we blind revels keep;</p>
<p class="t0">Whole buried towns support the dancer&rsquo;s heel.</p>
<p class="t0">The moist of human frame the sun exhales;</p>
<p class="t0">Winds scatter through the mighty void the dry;<span class="lnum"> 100</span></p>
<p class="t0">Earth repossesses part of what she gave,</p>
<p class="t0">And the freed spirit mounts on wings of fire;</p>
<p class="t0">Each element partakes our scatter&rsquo;d spoils;</p>
<p class="t0">As nature, wide, our ruins spread: man&rsquo;s death</p>
<p class="t0">Inhabits all things, but the thought of man.</p>
<p class="t">Nor man alone; his breathing bust expires,</p>
<p class="t0">His tomb is mortal; empires die: where, now,</p>
<p class="t0">The Roman? Greek? They stalk, an empty name!</p>
<p class="t0">Yet few regard them in this useful light;</p>
<p class="t0">Though half our learning is their epitaph.<span class="lnum"> 110</span></p>
<p class="t0">When down thy vale, unlock&rsquo;d by midnight thought,</p>
<p class="t0">That loves to wander in thy sunless realms,</p>
<p class="t0">O Death! I stretch my view: what visions rise!</p>
<p class="t0">What triumphs! toils imperial! arts divine!</p>
<p class="t0">In wither&rsquo;d laurels glide before my sight!</p>
<p class="t0">What lengths of far-famed ages, billow&rsquo;d high</p>
<p class="t0">With human agitation, roll along</p>
<p class="t0">In unsubstantial images of air!</p>
<p class="t0">The melancholy ghosts of dead renown,</p>
<p class="t0">Whispering faint echoes of the world&rsquo;s applause,<span class="lnum"> 120</span></p>
<p class="t0">With penitential aspect, as they pass,</p>
<p class="t0">All point at earth, and hiss at human pride,<span class="lnum"> 122</span></p>
<p class="t0">The wisdom of the wise, and prancings of the great.</p>
<p class="t">But, O Lorenzo! far the rest above,</p>
<p class="t0">Of ghastly nature, and enormous size,</p>
<p class="t0">One form assaults my sight, and chills my blood,</p>
<p class="t0">And shakes my frame. Of one departed world<sup><a id="fr_52" href="#fn_52">[52]</a></sup></p>
<p class="t0">I see the mighty shadow: oozy wreath</p>
<p class="t0">And dismal seaweed crown her; o&rsquo;er her urn</p>
<p class="t0">Reclined, she weeps her desolated realms,<span class="lnum"> 130</span></p>
<p class="t0">And bloated sons; and, weeping, prophesies</p>
<p class="t0">Another&rsquo;s dissolution, soon, in flames.</p>
<p class="t0">But, like Cassandra, prophesies in vain;</p>
<p class="t0">In vain, to many; not, I trust, to thee.</p>
<p class="t">For, know&rsquo;st thou not, or art thou loath to know,</p>
<p class="t0">The great decree, the counsel of the skies?</p>
<p class="t0">Deluge and conflagration, dreadful powers!</p>
<p class="t0">Prime ministers of vengeance! chain&rsquo;d in caves</p>
<p class="t0">Distinct, apart the giant furies roar;</p>
<p class="t0">Apart; or, such their horrid rage for ruin,<span class="lnum"> 140</span></p>
<p class="t0">In mutual conflict would they rise, and wage</p>
<p class="t0">Eternal war, till one was quite devour&rsquo;d.</p>
<p class="t0">But not for this, ordain&rsquo;d their boundless rage;</p>
<p class="t0">When Heaven&rsquo;s inferior instruments of wrath,</p>
<p class="t0">War, famine, pestilence, are found too weak</p>
<p class="t0">To scourge a world for her enormous crimes,</p>
<p class="t0">These are let loose, alternate: down they rush,</p>
<p class="t0">Swift and tempestuous, from th&rsquo; eternal throne,</p>
<p class="t0">With irresistible commission arm&rsquo;d,</p>
<p class="t0">The world, in vain corrected, to destroy,<span class="lnum"> 150</span></p>
<p class="t0">And ease creation of the shocking scene.</p>
<p class="t">Seest thou, Lorenzo! what depends on man?</p>
<p class="t0">The fate of Nature; as for man, her birth.</p>
<p class="t0">Earth&rsquo;s actors change earth&rsquo;s transitory scenes,</p>
<p class="t0">And make creation groan with human guilt.<span class="lnum"> 155</span></p>
<p class="t0">How must it groan, in a new deluge whelm&rsquo;d,</p>
<p class="t0">But not of waters! At the destined hour,</p>
<p class="t0">By the loud trumpet summon&rsquo;d to the charge,</p>
<p class="t0">See, all the formidable sons of fire,</p>
<p class="t0">Eruptions, earthquakes, comets, lightnings, play</p>
<p class="t0">Their various engines; all at once disgorge</p>
<p class="t0">Their blazing magazines; and take, by storm,<span class="lnum"> 162</span></p>
<p class="t0">This poor terrestrial citadel of man.</p>
<p class="t">Amazing period! when each mountain-height</p>
<p class="t0">Outburns Vesuvius; rocks eternal pour</p>
<p class="t0">Their melted mass, as rivers once they pour&rsquo;d;</p>
<p class="t0">Stars rush; and final Ruin fiercely drives</p>
<p class="t0">Her ploughshare o&rsquo;er creation!&mdash;while aloft,</p>
<p class="t0">More than astonishment! if more can be!</p>
<p class="t0">Far other firmament than e&rsquo;er was seen,<span class="lnum"> 170</span></p>
<p class="t0">Than e&rsquo;er was thought by man! far other stars!</p>
<p class="t0">Stars animate, that govern these of fire;</p>
<p class="t0">Far other sun!&mdash;A sun, O how unlike</p>
<p class="t0">The Babe at Bethlehem! how unlike the Man,</p>
<p class="t0">That groan&rsquo;d on Calvary!&mdash;Yet He it is;</p>
<p class="t0">That Man of Sorrows! O how changed! what pomp!</p>
<p class="t0">In grandeur terrible, all heaven descends!</p>
<p class="t0">And gods, ambitious, triumph in his train.</p>
<p class="t0">A swift archangel, with his golden wing,</p>
<p class="t0">As blots and clouds, that darken and disgrace<span class="lnum"> 180</span></p>
<p class="t0">The scene divine, sweeps stars and suns aside.</p>
<p class="t0">And now, all dross removed, heaven&rsquo;s own pure day,</p>
<p class="t0">Full on the confines of our ether, flames:</p>
<p class="t0">While (dreadful contrast!) far, how far beneath!</p>
<p class="t0">Hell, bursting, belches forth her blazing seas,</p>
<p class="t0">And storms sulphureous; her voracious jaws</p>
<p class="t0">Expanding wide, and roaring for her prey.</p>
<p class="t">Lorenzo! welcome to this scene; the last</p>

<p class="t0">This strikes, if aught can strike thee; this awakes</p>
<p class="t0">The most supine; this snatches man from death.</p>
<p class="t0">Rouse, rouse, Lorenzo, then, and follow me,</p>
<p class="t0">Where truth, the most momentous man can hear,</p>
<p class="t0">Loud calls my soul, and ardour wings her flight.</p>
<p class="t0">I find my inspiration in my theme:</p>
<p class="t0">The grandeur of my subject is my Muse.</p>
<p class="t">At midnight, when mankind is wrapt in peace,</p>
<p class="t0">And worldly fancy feeds on golden dreams;</p>
<p class="t0">To give more dread to man&rsquo;s most dreadful hour.</p>
<p class="t0">At midnight, &rsquo;tis presumed, this pomp will burst<span class="lnum"> 200</span></p>
<p class="t0">From tenfold darkness; sudden as the spark</p>
<p class="t0">From smitten steel; from nitrous grain, the blaze.</p>
<p class="t0">Man, starting from his couch, shall sleep no more!</p>
<p class="t0">The day is broke, which never more shall close!</p>
<p class="t0">Above, around, beneath, amazement all!</p>
<p class="t0">Terror and glory join&rsquo;d in their extremes!</p>
<p class="t0">Our God in grandeur, and our world on fire!</p>
<p class="t0">All nature struggling in the pangs of death!</p>
<p class="t0">Dost thou not hear her? Dost thou not deplore</p>
<p class="t0">Her strong convulsions, and her final groan?<span class="lnum"> 210</span></p>
<p class="t0">Where are we now? Ah me! the ground is gone,</p>
<p class="t0">On which we stood; Lorenzo! while thou may&rsquo;st,</p>
<p class="t0">Provide more firm support, or sink for ever!</p>
<p class="t0">Where? how? from whence? Vain hope! it is too late!</p>
<p class="t0">Where, where, for shelter, shall the guilty fly,</p>
<p class="t0">When consternation turns the good man pale?</p>
<p class="t">Great day! for which all other days were made;</p>
<p class="t0">For which earth rose from chaos, man from earth;</p>
<p class="t0">And an eternity, the date of gods,</p>
<p class="t0">Descended on poor earth-created man!<span class="lnum"> 220</span></p>
<p class="t0">Great day of dread, decision, and despair!</p>
<p class="t0">At thought of thee, each sublunary wish</p>
<p class="t0">Lets go its eager grasp, and drops the world;<span class="lnum"> 223</span></p>
<p class="t0">And catches at each reed of hope in heaven.</p>
<p class="t0">At thought of thee!&mdash;And art thou absent then?</p>
<p class="t0">Lorenzo! no; &rsquo;tis here; it is begun;&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">Already is begun the grand assize,</p>
<p class="t0">In thee, in all: deputed Conscience scales</p>
<p class="t0">The dread tribunal, and forestalls our doom;</p>
<p class="t0">Forestalls; and, by forestalling, proves it sure.<span class="lnum"> 230</span></p>
<p class="t0">Why on himself should man void judgment pass?</p>
<p class="t0">Is idle Nature laughing at her sons?</p>
<p class="t0">Who Conscience sent, her sentence will support,</p>
<p class="t0">And God above assert that God in man.</p>
<p class="t">Thrice happy they that enter now the court</p>
<p class="t0">Heaven opens in their bosoms! but, how rare,</p>
<p class="t0">Ah me! that magnanimity, how rare!</p>
<p class="t0">What hero, like the man who stands himself;</p>
<p class="t0">Who dares to meet his naked heart alone;</p>

<p class="t0">Night opes the noblest scenes, and sheds an awe,</p>

<p class="t0">Thy watery columns squirted to the clouds!</p>
<p class="t0">Thy basin&rsquo;d rivers, and imprison&rsquo;d seas!</p>
<p class="t0">Thy mountains moulded into forms of men!</p>
<p class="t0">Thy hundred-gated capitals! or those</p>
<p class="t0">Where three days&rsquo; travel left us much to ride;</p>
<p class="t0">Gazing on miracles by mortals wrought,</p>
<p class="t0">Arches triumphal, theatres immense,</p>
<p class="t0">Or nodding gardens pendent in mid-air!</p>
<p class="t0">Or temples proud to meet their gods half-way!</p>
<p class="t0">Yet these affect us in no common kind.<span class="lnum"> 930</span></p>
<p class="t0">What then the force of such superior scenes?</p>
<p class="t0">Enter a temple, it will strike an awe:<span class="lnum"> 932</span></p>
<p class="t0">What awe from this the Deity has built!</p>
<p class="t0">A good man seen, though silent, counsel gives:</p>
<p class="t0">The touch&rsquo;d spectator wishes to be wise:</p>
<p class="t0">In a bright mirror His own hands have made,</p>
<p class="t0">Here we see something like the face of God.</p>
<p class="t0">Seems it not then enough, to say, Lorenzo!</p>
<p class="t0">To man abandon&rsquo;d, &ldquo;Hast thou seen the skies?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t">And yet, so thwarted Nature&rsquo;s kind design<span class="lnum"> 940</span></p>
<p class="t0">By daring man, he makes her sacred awe</p>
<p class="t0">(That guard from ill) his shelter, his temptation</p>
<p class="t0">To more than common guilt, and quite inverts</p>
<p class="t0">Celestial art&rsquo;s intent. The trembling stars</p>
<p class="t0">See crimes gigantic, stalking through the gloom</p>
<p class="t0">With front erect, that hide their head by day,</p>
<p class="t0">And making night still darker by their deeds.</p>
<p class="t0">Slumbering in covert, till the shades descend,</p>
<p class="t0">Rapine and Murder, link&rsquo;d, now prowl for prey.</p>
<p class="t0">The miser earths his treasure; and the thief,<span class="lnum"> 950</span></p>
<p class="t0">Watching the mole, half beggars him ere morn.</p>
<p class="t0">Now plots, and foul conspiracies, awake;</p>
<p class="t0">And, muffling up their horrors from the moon,</p>
<p class="t0">Havoc and devastation they prepare,</p>
<p class="t0">And kingdoms tottering in the field of blood.</p>
<p class="t0">Now sons of riot in mid-revel rage.</p>
<p class="t0">What shall I do?&mdash;suppress it? or proclaim?&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">Why sleeps the thunder? Now, Lorenzo! now,</p>
<p class="t0">His best friend&rsquo;s couch the rank adulterer</p>
<p class="t0">Ascends secure; and laughs at gods and men.<span class="lnum"> 960</span></p>
<p class="t0">Preposterous madmen, void of fear or shame,</p>
<p class="t0">Lay their crimes bare to these chaste eyes of Heaven;</p>
<p class="t0">Yet shrink, and shudder, at a mortal&rsquo;s sight.</p>
<p class="t0">Were moon, and stars, for villains only made?</p>
<p class="t0">To guide, yet screen them, with tenebrious<sup><a id="fr_62" href="#fn_62">[62]</a></sup> light?</p>
<p class="t0">No; they were made to fashion the sublime<span class="lnum"> 966</span></p>
<p class="t0">Of human hearts, and wiser make the wise.</p>
<p class="t">Those ends were answer&rsquo;d once; when mortals lived</p>
<p class="t0">Of stronger wing, of aquiline ascent</p>
<p class="t0">In theory sublime. O how unlike</p>
<p class="t0">Those vermin of the night, this moment sung,</p>
<p class="t0">Who crawl on earth, and on her venom feed!<span class="lnum"> 972</span></p>
<p class="t0">Those ancient sages, human stars! They met</p>
<p class="t0">Their brothers of the skies, at midnight hour;</p>
<p class="t0">Their counsel ask&rsquo;d; and, what they ask&rsquo;d, obey&rsquo;d.</p>
<p class="t0">The Stagirite, and Plato, he who drank<sup><a id="fr_63" href="#fn_63">[63]</a></sup></p>
<p class="t0">The poison&rsquo;d bowl, and he of Tusculum,<sup><a id="fr_64" href="#fn_64">[64]</a></sup></p>

<p class="t0">In these unbounded, and Elysian, walks,</p>
<p class="t0">An area fit for gods, and godlike men,<span class="lnum"> 980</span></p>
<p class="t0">They took their nightly round, through radiant paths</p>
<p class="t0">By seraphs trod; instructed, chiefly, thus,</p>
<p class="t0">To tread in their bright footsteps here below;</p>
<p class="t0">To walk in worth still brighter than the skies.</p>
<p class="t0">There they contracted their contempt of earth;</p>
<p class="t0">Of hopes eternal kindled, there, the fire;</p>
<p class="t0">There, as in near approach, they glow&rsquo;d, and grew</p>
<p class="t0">(Great visitants!) more intimate with God,</p>
<p class="t0">More worth to men, more joyous to themselves.</p>
<p class="t0">Through various virtues, they, with ardour, ran<span class="lnum"> 990</span></p>
<p class="t0">The zodiac of their learn&rsquo;d, illustrious lives.</p>
<p class="t">In Christian hearts, O for a Pagan zeal!</p>
<p class="t0">A needful, but opprobrious prayer! As much</p>
<p class="t0">Our ardour less, as greater is our light.</p>
<p class="t0">How monstrous this in morals! Scarce more strange</p>
<p class="t0">Would this phenomenon in nature strike,</p>
<p class="t0">A sun, that froze her, or a star, that warm&rsquo;d.</p>
<p class="t0">What taught these heroes of the moral world?<span class="lnum"> 998</span></p>
<p class="t0">To these thou givest thy praise, give credit too.</p>
<p class="t0">These doctors ne&rsquo;er were pension&rsquo;d to deceive thee;</p>
<p class="t0">And Pagan tutors are thy taste.&mdash;They taught,</p>
<p class="t0">That, narrow views betray to misery:</p>
<p class="t0">That, wise it is to comprehend the whole:</p>
<p class="t0">That, virtue, rose from nature, ponder&rsquo;d well,</p>
<p class="t0">The single base of virtue built to heaven:</p>
<p class="t0">That God, and nature, our attention claim:</p>
<p class="t0">That nature is the glass reflecting God,</p>
<p class="t0">As, by the sea, reflected is the sun,</p>
<p class="t0">Too glorious to be gazed on in his sphere:</p>
<p class="t0">That, mind immortal loves immortal aims:<span class="lnum"> 1010</span></p>
<p class="t0">That, boundless mind affects a boundless space:</p>
<p class="t0">That vast surveys, and the sublime of things,</p>
<p class="t0">The soul assimilate, and make her great:</p>
<p class="t0">That, therefore, heaven her glories, as a fund</p>
<p class="t0">Of inspiration, thus spreads out to man.</p>
<p class="t0">Such are their doctrines; such the Night inspired.</p>
<p class="t">And what more true? what truth of greater weight?</p>
<p class="t0">The soul of man was made to walk the skies;</p>
<p class="t0">Delightful outlet of her prison here!</p>
<p class="t0">There, disencumber&rsquo;d from her chains, the ties<span class="lnum"> 1020</span></p>
<p class="t0">Of toys terrestrial, she can rove at large;</p>
<p class="t0">There, freely can respire, dilate, extend,</p>
<p class="t0">In full proportion let loose all her powers;</p>
<p class="t0">And, undeluded, grasp at something great.</p>
<p class="t0">Nor, as a stranger, does she wander there;</p>
<p class="t0">But, wonderful herself, through wonder strays;</p>
<p class="t0">Contemplating their grandeur, finds her own;</p>
<p class="t0">Dives deep in their economy divine,</p>
<p class="t0">Sits high in judgment on their various laws,</p>
<p class="t0">And, like a master, judges not amiss.<span class="lnum"> 1030</span></p>
<p class="t0">Hence greatly pleased, and justly proud, the soul</p>
<p class="t0">Grows conscious of her birth celestial; breathes<span class="lnum"> 1032</span></p>
<p class="t0">More life, more vigour, in her native air;</p>
<p class="t0">And feels herself at home amongst the stars;</p>
<p class="t0">And, feeling, emulates her country&rsquo;s praise.</p>
<p class="t">What call we, then, the firmament, Lorenzo?&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">As earth the body, since the skies sustain</p>
<p class="t0">The soul with food, that gives immortal life,</p>
<p class="t0">Call it, the noble pasture of the mind;</p>
<p class="t0">Which there expatiates, strengthens, and exults,<span class="lnum"> 1040</span></p>
<p class="t0">And riots through the luxuries of thought.</p>
<p class="t0">Call it, the garden of the Deity,</p>
<p class="t0">Blossom&rsquo;d with stars, redundant in the growth</p>
<p class="t0">Of fruit ambrosial; moral fruit to man.</p>
<p class="t0">Call it, the breastplate of the true High Priest,</p>
<p class="t0">Ardent with gems oracular, that give,</p>
<p class="t0">In points of highest moment, right response;</p>
<p class="t0">And ill neglected, if we prize our peace.</p>
<p class="t">Thus, have we found a true astrology;</p>
<p class="t0">Thus, have we found a new, and noble sense,<span class="lnum"> 1050</span></p>
<p class="t0">In which alone stars govern human fates.</p>
<p class="t0">O that the stars (as some have feign&rsquo;d) let fall</p>
<p class="t0">Bloodshed, and havoc, on embattled realms,</p>
<p class="t0">And rescued monarchs from so black a guilt!</p>
<p class="t0">Bourbon! this wish how generous in a foe!</p>
<p class="t0">Would&rsquo;st thou be great, would&rsquo;st thou become a god,</p>
<p class="t0">And stick thy deathless name among the stars,</p>
<p class="t0">For mighty conquests on a needle&rsquo;s point?</p>
<p class="t0">Instead of forging chains for foreigners,</p>

<p class="t0">As yet thou know&rsquo;st not what it is: how great,</p>
<p class="t0">How glorious, then, appears the mind of man,</p>
<p class="t0">When in it all the stars, and planets, roll!</p>
<p class="t0">And what it seems, it is: great objects make</p>
<p class="t0">Great minds, enlarging as their views enlarge;<span class="lnum"> 1065</span></p>
<p class="t0">Those still more godlike, as these more divine.</p>
<p class="t">And more divine than these, thou canst not see.</p>
<p class="t0">Dazzled, o&rsquo;erpower&rsquo;d, with the delicious draught</p>
<p class="t0">Of miscellaneous splendours, how I reel</p>
<p class="t0">From thought to thought, inebriate, without end!</p>
<p class="t0">An Eden, this! a Paradise unlost!</p>
<p class="t0">I meet the Deity in every view,<span class="lnum"> 1072</span></p>
<p class="t0">And tremble at my nakedness before him!</p>
<p class="t0">O that I could but reach the tree of life!</p>
<p class="t0">For here it grows, unguarded from our taste;</p>
<p class="t0">No flaming sword denies our entrance here;</p>
<p class="t0">Would man but gather, he might live for ever.</p>
<p class="t">Lorenzo! much of moral hast thou seen.</p>
<p class="t0">Of curious arts art thou more fond? Then mark</p>
<p class="t0">The mathematic glories of the skies,<span class="lnum"> 1080</span></p>
<p class="t0">In number, weight, and measure, all ordain&rsquo;d.</p>
<p class="t0">Lorenzo&rsquo;s boasted builders, Chance, and Fate,</p>
<p class="t0">Are left to finish his a&euml;rial towers;</p>
<p class="t0">Wisdom and choice, their well-known characters</p>
<p class="t0">Here deep impress; and claim it for their own.</p>
<p class="t0">Though splendid all, no splendour void of use;</p>
<p class="t0">Use rivals beauty; art contends with power;</p>
<p class="t0">No wanton waste, amid effuse expense;</p>
<p class="t0">The great Economist adjusting all</p>
<p class="t0">To prudent pomp, magnificently wise.<span class="lnum"> 1090</span></p>
<p class="t0">How rich the prospect! and for ever new!</p>
<p class="t0">And newest to the man that views it most;</p>
<p class="t0">For newer still in infinite succeeds.</p>
<p class="t0">Then, these a&euml;rial racers, O how swift!</p>
<p class="t0">How the shaft loiters from the strongest string!</p>
<p class="t0">Spirit alone can distance the career.</p>
<p class="t0">Orb above orb ascending without end!</p>
<p class="t0">Circle in circle, without end, enclosed!</p>
<p class="t0">Wheel, within wheel; Ezekiel! like to thine!<span class="lnum"> 1099</span></p>
<p class="t0">Like thine, it seems a vision or a dream;</p>
<p class="t0">Though seen, we labour to believe it true!</p>
<p class="t0">What involution! what extent! what swarms</p>
<p class="t0">Of worlds, that laugh at earth! immensely great!</p>
<p class="t0">Immensely distant from each other&rsquo;s spheres!</p>
<p class="t0">What, then, the wondrous space through which they roll?</p>
<p class="t0">At once it quite engulfs all human thought;</p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Tis comprehension&rsquo;s absolute defeat.</p>
<p class="t">Nor think thou seest a wild disorder here;</p>
<p class="t0">Through this illustrious chaos to the sight,</p>
<p class="t0">Arrangement neat, and chastest order, reign.<span class="lnum"> 1110</span></p>
<p class="t0">The path prescribed, inviolably kept,</p>
<p class="t0">Upbraids the lawless sallies of mankind.</p>
<p class="t0">Worlds, ever thwarting, never interfere;</p>
<p class="t0">What knots are tied! how soon are they dissolved,</p>
<p class="t0">And set the seeming married planets free!</p>
<p class="t0">They rove for ever, without error rove;</p>
<p class="t0">Confusion unconfused! nor less admire</p>
<p class="t0">This tumult untumultuous; all on wing!</p>
<p class="t0">In motion, all! yet what profound repose!</p>
<p class="t0">What fervid action, yet no noise! as awed<span class="lnum"> 1120</span></p>
<p class="t0">To silence, by the presence of their Lord;</p>
<p class="t0">Or hush&rsquo;d by His command, in love to man,</p>
<p class="t0">And bid let fall soft beams on human rest,</p>
<p class="t0">Restless themselves. On yon cerulean plain,</p>
<p class="t0">In exultation to their God, and thine,</p>
<p class="t0">They dance, they sing eternal jubilee,</p>
<p class="t0">Eternal celebration of His praise.</p>
<p class="t0">But, since their song arrives not at our ear,</p>
<p class="t0">Their dance perplex&rsquo;d exhibits to the sight</p>
<p class="t0">Fair hieroglyphic of His peerless power.<span class="lnum"> 1130</span></p>
<p class="t0">Mark how the labyrinthian turns they take,</p>
<p class="t0">The circles intricate, and mystic maze,</p>
<p class="t0">Weave the grand cipher of Omnipotence;<span class="lnum"> 1133</span></p>
<p class="t0">To gods, how great! how legible to man!</p>
<p class="t">Leaves so much wonder greater wonder still?</p>
<p class="t0">Where are the pillars that support the skies?</p>
<p class="t0">What more than Atlantean shoulder props</p>
<p class="t0">Th&rsquo; incumbent load? What magic, what strange art,</p>
<p class="t0">In fluid air these ponderous orbs sustains?</p>
<p class="t0">Who would not think them hung in golden chains?&mdash;<span class="lnum"> 1140</span></p>
<p class="t0">And so they are; in the high will of heaven,</p>
<p class="t0">Which fixes all; makes adamant of air,</p>
<p class="t0">Or air of adamant; makes all of nought,</p>
<p class="t0">Or nought of all; if such the dread decree.</p>
<p class="t">Imagine from their deep foundations torn</p>
<p class="t0">The most gigantic sons of earth, the broad</p>
<p class="t0">And towering Alps, all toss&rsquo;d into the sea;</p>
<p class="t0">And, light as down, or volatile as air,</p>
<p class="t0">Their bulks enormous, dancing on the waves,</p>
<p class="t0">In time, and measure, exquisite; while all<span class="lnum"> 1150</span></p>
<p class="t0">The winds, in emulation of the spheres,</p>
<p class="t0">Tune their sonorous instruments aloft;</p>
<p class="t0">The concert swell, and animate the ball.</p>
<p class="t0">Would this appear amazing? What, then, worlds,</p>
<p class="t0">In a far thinner element sustain&rsquo;d,</p>
<p class="t0">And acting the same part, with greater skill,</p>
<p class="t0">More rapid movement, and for noblest ends?</p>
<p class="t">More obvious ends to pass, are not these stars</p>
<p class="t0">The seats majestic, proud imperial thrones,</p>
<p class="t0">On which angelic delegates of heaven,<span class="lnum"> 1160</span></p>
<p class="t0">At certain periods, as the Sovereign nods,</p>
<p class="t0">Discharge high trusts of vengeance, or of love;</p>
<p class="t0">To clothe, in outward grandeur, grand design,</p>
<p class="t0">And acts most solemn still more solemnize?</p>
<p class="t0">Ye citizens of air! what ardent thanks,</p>
<p class="t0">What full effusion of the grateful heart,</p>
<p class="t0">Is due from man indulged in such a sight!<span class="lnum"> 1167</span></p>
<p class="t0">A sight so noble! and a sight so kind!</p>
<p class="t0">It drops new truths at every new survey!</p>
<p class="t0">Feels not Lorenzo something stir within,</p>
<p class="t0">That sweeps away all period? As these spheres</p>
<p class="t0">Measure duration, they no less inspire</p>
<p class="t0">The godlike hope of ages without end.</p>
<p class="t0">The boundless space, through which these rovers take</p>
<p class="t0">Their restless roam, suggests the sister thought</p>
<p class="t0">Of boundless time. Thus, by kind Nature&rsquo;s skill,</p>
<p class="t0">To man unlabour&rsquo;d, that important guest,</p>
<p class="t0">Eternity, finds entrance at the sight:</p>
<p class="t0">And an eternity, for man ordain&rsquo;d,</p>
<p class="t0">Or these his destined midnight counsellors,<span class="lnum"> 1180</span></p>
<p class="t0">The stars, had never whisper&rsquo;d it to man.</p>
<p class="t0">Nature informs, but ne&rsquo;er insults, her sons.</p>
<p class="t0">Could she then kindle the most ardent wish</p>
<p class="t0">To disappoint it?&mdash;That is blasphemy.</p>
<p class="t0">Thus, of thy creed a second article,</p>
<p class="t0">Momentous, as th&rsquo; existence of a God,</p>
<p class="t0">Is found (as I conceive) where rarely sought;</p>
<p class="t0">And thou may&rsquo;st read thy soul immortal, here.</p>
<p class="t">Here, then, Lorenzo! on these glories dwell;</p>
<p class="t0">Nor want the gilt, illuminated, roof,<span class="lnum"> 1190</span></p>
<p class="t0">That calls the wretched gay to dark delights.</p>
<p class="t0">Assemblies?&mdash;This is one divinely bright;</p>
<p class="t0">Here, unendanger&rsquo;d in health, wealth, or fame,</p>
<p class="t0">Range through the fairest, and the Sultan scorn;</p>
<p class="t0">He, wise as thou, no crescent holds so fair,</p>
<p class="t0">As that, which on his turban awes a world;</p>
<p class="t0">And thinks the moon is proud to copy him.</p>
<p class="t0">Look on her, and gain more than worlds can give,</p>
<p class="t0">A mind superior to the charms of power.</p>
<p class="t0">Thou muffled in delusions of this life!<span class="lnum"> 1200</span></p>
<p class="t0">Can yonder moon turn ocean in his bed,<span class="lnum"> 1201</span></p>
<p class="t0">From side to side, in constant ebb, and flow,</p>
<p class="t0">And purify from stench his watery realms?</p>
<p class="t0">And fails her moral influence? wants she power</p>
<p class="t0">To turn Lorenzo&rsquo;s stubborn tide of thought</p>
<p class="t0">From stagnating on earth&rsquo;s infected shore,</p>
<p class="t0">And purge from nuisance his corrupted heart?</p>
<p class="t0">Fails her attraction when it draws to heaven?</p>
<p class="t0">Nay, and to what thou valuest more, earth&rsquo;s joy?</p>
<p class="t0">Minds elevate, and panting for unseen,<span class="lnum"> 1210</span></p>
<p class="t0">And defecate<sup><a id="fr_66" href="#fn_66">[66]</a></sup> from sense, alone obtain</p>
<p class="t0">Full relish of existence undeflower&rsquo;d,</p>
<p class="t0">The life of life, the zest of worldly bliss:</p>
<p class="t0">All else on earth amounts&mdash;to what? to this:</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Bad to be suffer&rsquo;d; blessings to be left:&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">Earth&rsquo;s richest inventory boasts no more.</p>
<p class="t">Of higher scenes be, then, the call obey&rsquo;d.</p>
<p class="t0">O let me gaze!&mdash;Of gazing there&rsquo;s no end.</p>
<p class="t0">O let me think!&mdash;Thought too is wilder&rsquo;d here;</p>
<p class="t0">In midway flight imagination tires;<span class="lnum"> 1220</span></p>
<p class="t0">Yet soon reprunes her wing to soar anew,</p>
<p class="t0">Her point unable to forbear, or gain;</p>
<p class="t0">So great the pleasure, so profound the plan!</p>
<p class="t0">A banquet, this, where men, and angels, meet,</p>
<p class="t0">Eat the same manna, mingle earth and heaven.</p>
<p class="t0">How distant some of these nocturnal suns!</p>
<p class="t0">So distant (says the sage), &rsquo;twere not absurd</p>
<p class="t0">To doubt, if beams, set out at Nature&rsquo;s birth,</p>
<p class="t0">Are yet arrived at this so foreign world;</p>
<p class="t0">Though nothing half so rapid as their flight.<span class="lnum"> 1230</span></p>
<p class="t0">An eye of awe and wonder let me roll,</p>
<p class="t0">And roll for ever: who can satiate sight</p>
<p class="t0">In such a scene? in such an ocean wide</p>
<p class="t0">Of deep astonishment? where depth, height, breadth,</p>
<p class="t0">Are lost in their extremes; and where to count<span class="lnum"> 1235</span></p>
<p class="t0">The thick-sown glories in this field of fire,</p>
<p class="t0">Perhaps a seraph&rsquo;s computation fails.</p>
<p class="t0">Now, go, Ambition! boast thy boundless might</p>
<p class="t0">In conquest, o&rsquo;er the tenth part of a grain.</p>
<p class="t">And yet Lorenzo calls for miracles,</p>
<p class="t0">To give his tottering faith a solid base.</p>
<p class="t0">Why call for less than is already thine?<span class="lnum"> 1242</span></p>
<p class="t0">Thou art no novice in theology;</p>
<p class="t0">What is a miracle?&mdash;&rsquo;Tis a reproach,</p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Tis an implicit satire, on mankind;</p>
<p class="t0">And while it satisfies, it censures too.</p>
<p class="t0">To common sense, great Nature&rsquo;s course proclaims</p>
<p class="t0">A Deity: when mankind falls asleep,</p>
<p class="t0">A miracle is sent, as an alarm;</p>
<p class="t0">To wake the world, and prove Him o&rsquo;er again,<span class="lnum"> 1250</span></p>
<p class="t0">By recent argument, but not more strong.</p>
<p class="t0">Say, which imports more plenitude of power,</p>
<p class="t0">Or nature&rsquo;s laws to fix, or to repeal?</p>
<p class="t0">To make a sun, or stop his mid career?</p>

<p class="t0">But what eternal?&mdash;Why not human race?</p>
<p class="t0">And Adam&rsquo;s ancestors without an end?&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">That&rsquo;s hard to be conceived; since every link</p>
<p class="t0">Of that long-chain&rsquo;d succession is so frail;</p>
<p class="t0">Can every part depend, and not the whole?</p>
<p class="t0">Yet grant it true; new difficulties rise;</p>
<p class="t0">I&rsquo;m still quite out at sea; nor see the shore.</p>
<p class="t0">Whence earth, and these bright orbs?&mdash;eternal too?</p>

<p class="t0">Would want some other father;&mdash;much design</p>
<p class="t0">Is seen in all their motions, all their makes;</p>
<p class="t0">Design implies intelligence, and art;</p>
<p class="t0">That can&rsquo;t be from themselves&mdash;or man; that art</p>

<p class="t0">Such various forms, and gave it wings to fly?</p>
<p class="t0">Has matter innate motion? then each atom,</p>
<p class="t0">Asserting its indisputable right<span class="lnum"> 1473</span></p>
<p class="t0">To dance, would form an universe of dust:</p>
<p class="t0">Has matter none? Then whence these glorious forms</p>
<p class="t0">And boundless flights, from shapeless, and reposed?</p>
<p class="t0">Has matter more than motion? Has it thought,</p>
<p class="t0">Judgment, and genius? Is it deeply learn&rsquo;d</p>
<p class="t0">In mathematics? Has it framed such laws,</p>

<h4>ISSUE FOR THE SECOND YEAR.</h4>
<p class="center">The Publisher begs to announce that the Issue for the Second Year
will consist of the Poetical Works of</p>
<p class="center"><b>BUTLER, 2 vols.; COWPER, 3 vols.; BLAIR, BRUCE, LOGAN,

<p>The Publisher has much gratification in referring to the reception
which this Series of the British Poets has met with, and he begs to
assure the Subscribers that every exertion will be made to insure this
Edition being distinguished by the specific features proposed, namely,
&ldquo;accuracy in the text, elegance of appearance, and extreme cheapness.&rdquo;
The arrangements which now exist for collating the text, and
securing accuracy in this important feature, are such as warrant the
assertion that this Edition will be found to stand a favourable comparison
with any hitherto published, or any that may hereafter be
issued.</p>
<p>The Publisher and Editor have peculiar pleasure in acknowledging
the ready and hearty approval of their efforts by the press. It is
seldom that any undertaking has been so warmly received, or the
manner in which it has been executed so generally approved. This
appreciation of their purpose will stimulate them to still greater exertions
in the prosecution of their design&mdash;to produce this portion of
the standard literature of our country in a style more befitting the
merits of the authors than any hitherto attempted, and to secure for
this series that it shall be worthy of recognition as</p>

<p><i>The Publisher has pleasure in submitting the following Extracts from recent
Notices which have appeared of the Vols. already issued:</i>&mdash;</p>
<p class="center"><b>Literary Gazette.</b></p>
<p>Coleridge said, that for a man fully to appreciate George Herbert, he must
be &ldquo;an affectionate and dutiful son of the Church, and from habit, conviction,
and a constitutional predisposition to ceremoniousness in piety as in manners,
find her forms and ordinances aids of religion, not sources of formality.&rdquo; Mr
Gilfillan has none of the qualifications here described, yet never was the character
of Herbert more highly appreciated, nor his poetry more unreservedly admired,
than by this Presbyterian editor. The editorial work is done with true Christian
liberality, and with the sympathy of a man of genius. The present volume
forms one of the new series of the &ldquo;English Poetical Classics,&rdquo; published by Mr
Nichol of Edinburgh. In typography and appearance they are very superior,
and they are issued at a price of unusual cheapness. The series will form a
beautiful and valuable library edition of the English Classic Poets.</p>
<p class="center"><b>Scottish Review.</b></p>
<p>In this age of puffs and puffing, it is really pleasing to find pretensions at
first somewhat startling, though modestly enough proclaimed, so well sustained.
Six such volumes for twenty-one shillings! We are not surprised that they are
said to be &ldquo;offered at about one-third of the usual selling price.&rdquo; Independently
altogether of the original matter furnished by Mr Gilfillan, the poetical works of
John Milton, produced in such a style, are certainly worthy of a place in the
best libraries. We know of no issue from the press which, as to paper, type,
and general getting up, commends itself to public favour at so small a charge.</p>
<p class="center"><b>Eclectic Review.</b></p>
<p>The proposal issued by Mr Nichol is remarkable even in this age of cheap
literature, and will go far to supply what has been long needed,&mdash;an accurate,
elegant, and cheap edition of our Poets. Such a guinea&rsquo;s worth was never
issued before, and we are much mistaken if the series does not obtain a large
circulation. The volumes are issued in handsome style, and every care will be
taken to secure the accuracy of the editions. Mr Gilfillan&rsquo;s temperament
<span class="pb" id="pg_358">[358]</span>
involves some of the choicest elements of poetic impressions, while his critical
canons are for the most part sound and trustworthy.</p>
<p class="center"><b>Perthshire Courier.</b></p>
<p>It is almost unnecessary for us to say more than what is now universally
admitted, that this is the best and cheapest edition of the British Poets ever
offered to the public. Setting aside their acknowledged and standard elegance,
they are the cheapest books we have ever seen, and their being indispensable to
the literary man, as well as the educated gentleman or well-read artisan, makes
them doubly so.</p>
<p class="center"><b>Tait&rsquo;s Magazine.</b></p>
<p>These volumes form part of a new series of the &ldquo;British Poets,&rdquo; published
by Mr Nichol, in the form of substantial and elegant library volumes, at a price
less than one third of that which the public have been accustomed to pay for
tomes of such goodly parts and quality. Paper, print, and binding, are all
excellent, the type large and clear.... The above extracts, more than
anything we could say, will commend these volumes, and the series of which
they form a part, to the good opinion of the reader. As a cheap and excellent
library edition of the &ldquo;British Poets,&rdquo; they will prove acceptable to a very
numerous class; and under the management of their present able editor, we
cannot harbour a doubt of their success with the public.</p>
<p class="center"><b>The Monitor.</b></p>
<p>When it was proposed that, at so low a price as a subscription of a guinea
in the year, six volumes, in a superior style of execution, would be issued, we
could not but admire the enterprise of the publisher, and heartily wish all
success to the undertaking.</p>
<p>These volumes, the first in the series, fully justified our fondest anticipations,
and give large promise that this admirable publication will secure, as it
certainly deserves, extensive patronage. They are issued in a very attractive
style&mdash;in a large bold type, paper of the best quality, and in neat and substantial
binding. The editorial part of the undertaking is carefully and ably executed.
Indeed, we know no living person who is better qualified to edit a uniform
edition of the British Poets than the Rev. George Gilfillan. We tender to both
the publisher and editor of this beautiful superior edition of the British Poets our
grateful acknowledgments for commencing so important and valuable an undertaking.</p>
<p class="center"><b>Clydesdale Journal.</b></p>
<p>This series has now reached the fourth volume, and is fully sustaining the
very favourable opinion expressed by the press in all parts of the country.
Never was a work issued combining elegance and cheapness in so remarkable a
degree.</p>
<p class="center"><b>Bell&rsquo;s Weekly Messenger.</b></p>
<p>This volume is an additional proof of the excellency of the selection, the
ability of the gifted editor, and the elegance of the publication.</p>
<p class="center"><b>Cumberland Pacquet.</b></p>
<p>This is the fourth volume of the library edition of the British Poets, projected
by Mr Nichol, the enterprising Edinburgh publisher, one or two of the
<span class="pb" id="pg_359">[359]</span>
former volumes of which we have already had the pleasure of noticing. The
design, and the style in which it was proposed to carry it out, as indicated by
the first volume of the series, elicited the expression of our special admiration
several months ago, and we have pleasure in stating that the volume now before
us is in every respect a worthy successor to those which have preceded it. We
may observe that the critical dissertation prefixed, from the pen of Mr Gilfillan,
is worth the price of the entire volume.</p>
<p class="center"><b>Aberdeen Journal.</b></p>
<p>... A few words respecting the series of publications of which this volume
forms a part. They are issued, as our readers are aware, under the very
efficient superintendence of George Gilfillan; and we cannot speak of them but
in terms of the warmest approval; for, in point of form and elegance, and correctness
of typography, they are on a level with the high-priced editions; and in
point of price, they are on a level with the most ordinary publications of popular
works that have been got up for the popular market. The enterprise is indeed a
noble one, and we wish it all manner of success.</p>
<p class="center"><b>Dumfriesshire and Galloway Herald.</b></p>
<p>This is the fourth volume of the new Edinburgh edition of the Poets&mdash;an
edition, we must say, alike honourable to the publisher and editor. Mr Nichol&rsquo;s
undertaking is a noble one. We wish him all success in it.</p>
<p class="center"><b>Glasgow Citizen.</b></p>
<p>The edition before us, with its ample page and masculine type&mdash;very suitable
for feeble eyes&mdash;forms part of Nichol&rsquo;s fine and wonderfully cheap issue of
the British Poets, under the able editorship of Mr Gilfillan. Four volumes are
now out, comprising the works of Milton, Thomson, and Herbert.</p>
<p class="center"><b>Newcastle Chronicle.</b></p>
<p>The paper and printing of this volume, as of the others, are, however,
beyond all praise, when compared with other &ldquo;people&rsquo;s editions.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><b>Montrose, Arbroath, and Brechin Review.</b></p>
<p>The editorial part is admirably performed by Mr Gilfillan; the getting up
quite the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of elegance and correctness; and the price (six volumes
for a guinea) is perhaps the very greatest marvel of this marvellous age of cheap
publications.</p>
<p class="center"><b>Commonwealth.</b></p>
<p>Regarded as specimens of typography&mdash;as books, in short, in the mere sense
of what is mechanical, they are among the most perfect we have seen. This
new edition of the British Poets is an undertaking which is worthy of commendation
and encouragement, even apart from the considerations to which we have
alluded.</p>
<p class="center"><b>The National Miscellany.</b></p>
<p>It is a bold speculation on the part of a publisher to offer six handsome
and well printed volumes for a guinea.... The printing, binding, and general
appearance is far superior to what we could have at all expected for the price;
and the series being issued under the superintendence of a careful editor, entirely
fulfils the import of the title, a <span class="sc">Library Edition</span>. The works which have already
appeared, are those of Milton, Herbert, and Thomson.</p>

<h2>Transcriber&rsquo;s Notes to this Electronic Edition</h2>
<ul>
<li>Several palpable typos in the original were silently corrected,
after consulting other printed editions.</li>
<li>In the Distributed Proofreaders community, it is customary to
flag any aspect of the text that seems wrong, for the final editor
to double-check. It&rsquo;s also customary for later proofreaders
to provide their own analysis. On this project, those proofers&rsquo;
notes&mdash;as explanations of why the printed text was correct&mdash;so
often proved enlightening as to its meaning, that the postprocessor
retained them as footnotes. They are distinguished from the
original editor&rsquo;s notes by a suffix &ldquo;&mdash;ee&rdquo;
(&ldquo;electronic edition&rdquo;).</li>
